The Python code in this repository is broken down by general type of text-analysis being performed and then is broken down into more specific outputs and algorithms. Within these more specific outputs and/or algoorithms they are organized by notebooks or scripts. The notebooks exist as tutorials to lead you through the scripts found in the scripts sections. The notebooks use the same code as the scripts, but provide extensive explanation for the scripts as well as example outputs.

=========================

HOW TO USE:

For quick access to the notebooks, click on the .ipynb version of the code in which you are interested. The .ipynb will open in the same Github window you currently have open. You can also download this for reference.

If you would like to view the notebooks in a Jupyter Notebook, download the .ipynb files and open them in Jupyter Notebook. Jupyter Notebook is already installed and ready to go on Research Desktop (ReD) which runs on Carbonate. If you are running these notebooks on your own computer, you will need to have Jupyter Notebook installed. We have instructions on how to do that here: https://github.com/cyberdh/Text-Analysis/blob/master/installJupyterMacPC.ipynb

Jupyter Notebook automatically displays all the files and folders in your home directory (which is your Carbonate directory under your username on Carbonate and varies on a Mac or PC), so make sure you save the repository in your home directory. Open the Text-Analysis folder and then open the folder of the type of Text-Analysis (TopicModeling, VADERSentimentAnalysis, WordFrequencies) you want and then the more specific type/algorithm and then finally the notebooks folder and choose the .ipynb file of your choice.

=========================

#### Please note: The code in this repo is intended for use on ReD and therefore Carbonate, the supercomputer at Indiana University. Carbonate is a Linux system and uses Python version 2.7 and 3.6 and so some of this code may need to be altered if you are using a different version on another computer.

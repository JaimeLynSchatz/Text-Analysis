text"By far the biggest problems I have experienced have been related to lack of knowledge of glitches in using Canvas, and Canvas in general.""Canvas is not user friendly. Most of my time with UITS is about Canvas issues, but not all staff have a good understanding of the platform."Contacting UITS by phone has been really useful on multiple occasions. I really appreciate being able to call them at any time. "I'm not positive what role UITS plays in this, but the annual ballots that are sent to IUB faculty to nominate and vote for BFC members has this problem: One cannot go back to modify one's votes, even when one simply wants to go back and add more nominations/votes rather than to actually change one's existing nominations/votes."I always appreciate quick responses from UITS staff members in a timely manner but it may be more convenient for us if the email can be forwarded to the appropriate department when the question was submitted to a department but should be better accommodated by other department."I am a visiting lecturer, teaching at Indiana University (Bloomington) for just the Spring semester of 2017. During this limited period I have had very limited experience with UITS, but the experience that I have had has been highly satisfying. I have contacted UITS staff on two occasions (had problems with projecting video material in class; a minor technical matter with posting on Canvas); both times staffers were nice and very helpful."I appreciate the availability and access to technical assistance through the knowledge base and call center.I feel as if the service and information I receive from my school-level IT support is significantly better than that received from UITS overall. So my overall ratings may be somewhat biased since I feel UITS suffers by comparison.By far my biggest complaint is the amount of time the Exchange server is inoperable. I literally run my day and manage my tasks using Outlook to such an extent that server downtime is DOWN time for me. Not being able to depend on Outlook is highly problematic."Finally, I find it annoying that in OneIU, when I click on a program icon, I am taken to a description of that program rather than to the program itself. Often the link for where to access/begin the actual program is not obvious, so I'm stuck looking at informational data I don't need to use a program that I cannot find. Once I've accessed a program once, could the system route me directly to it or its login screen rather than to the information page?""I rarely deal directly with UITS, mostly dealing with IT people in the building. My experiences with UITS have been generally positive though.""One thing the survey reminded me of--I find the telephone system very difficult to use. I would like it to be a good deal easier to transfer people, and I'd really like to be able to pick up other phones in my area from my desk phone."I really like UITS. Every time I call they are enormously helpful. One time I called shortly after changing my password and my account froze because my phone had tried to log me on with the wrong password multiple times. Even though it was outside of business hours the young woman was able to help me immediately. I love that I can look information up quickly and find a UITS page devoted to most topics."I wish students would use you more, instead of asking me for help. It's actually really shocking to me how little students know about computers. (I know, I know, ""kids these days."") Students these days seem to know how to point and click and that's it. I told them about computer code/computer programming and many had no idea. It's painful for me to watch a student navigate his/her screen with the mouse instead of using a few simple keyboard shortcuts.""I receive most of my IT support through CITO and have had great service. I have not had any issues with central services such as software downloads, etc. I'm not as enthusiastic about the need to use creative cloud to get some applications and the requirement to establish an adobe account that has to be renewed yearly."It would be helpful to have emergency class services in lecture rooms. Sometimes equipment is broken and only apparent on the day of the lecture. Some sort of phone # etc. in the rooms to call would be helpful."It's imperative that there be better notification of system outages that effect many users (e.g., e-mail, login)."IU mobile print has not been working well since Jan. 2017. I hope the issue can be fixed as soon as possible.I've had only positive experiences so far."My experiences with UITS staff have been extremely positive. I had a team of Techs come to my class during the first week of classes to make sure that the Wi-Fi was strong enough to use TopHat and to help any students who encountered problems logging on. I have also been in contact with the IT training team to arrange instruction for my class on how to use some of the software available through IUWare/IUAnyware. I also received support from UITS in setting up my IU Google calendar with scheduling slots for students to book meetings during my office hours. All of the people I have worked with have been tremendously professional, helpful, and prompt in their efforts.""I have had some issues with IU tech products, though I haven't actually sought help in resolving those problems. I was unable, for example, to get the Citrix receiver to work correctly on either my laptop or my office desktop computer, which means that I have been unable to use IUAnyware. I have also had issues getting my office phone to work properly, and I frequently get voice messages for someone who is not me, but I almost never use that phone, so I've never bothered to try to fix the problems. ""Also, as a qualitative researcher and someone who teaches [IRD], I find it frustrating that there are no qualitative data analysis software programs (Atlas.ti, Nvivo, MAXQDA, etc.) included in IUWare or IUAnyware. This makes it difficult to teach qualitative data analysis, as students are required to purchase their own licenses or use one of the small handful of computers that have this software installed. ""In terms of IU systems, I find one.iu.edu to be somewhat confusing to navigate. The search option is nice, but it seems to work only if you know the precise key words associated with a given application. Also, when multiple options return in the search, it is not always clear which option is the ""correct"" one to choose, and the lack of description with each application icon makes it even harder to judge. Also, the use of ratings stars makes me hesitant sometimes to even open a given application if it gets a very low rating."My interactions lately have been with the help center. I call them about problems that I have with the webserver (webserve) and generally have had nothing but great interactions with the helpful people manning the phones.No concerns or negative feelings."Overall my impressions of UITS are very positive. My only complaint is that it sometimes seems that we switch systems more often than is really necessary. I wonder how much of this is driven by evolving feature sets, with newer systems having features that seem very attractive but in reality are used by very few faculty and staff.""One other problem has to do with Wi-Fi. A couple of years back I switched from Windows to Mac. At the time my Mac would sometimes have difficulty connecting to IU Secure, and I would say that is still a problem. I can understand catering mostly to the Windows/PC environment years ago, but Macs are so prevalent now it seems that there should be no real difference in support across platforms.""People in tech support are friendly, but not always knowledgeable. I found that especially when it comes to Canvas, they are often at sea.""Also, the two-step authentication process is too restrictive. It's too much to require authentication via Duo multiple times *a day*."Canvas is among the most poorly implemented systems I have come across. Please get rid of it along with the people who promoted its adoption."Phone services put us at a disadvantage should the computer be locked and a threat occur. Box has been satisfactory, however the biggest downfall is the terrible lack of organization for shared files. Most faculty have more than 20 shared files which cannot be organized in any meaningful manner."Staff always seem competent and helpful to me. Log in at Griggs seems to take a long time.The UITS staff has always responded to various questions and problems and helped answer questions. They have always been pleasant and never made me feel that my questions were a waste of there time. I do not have anything negative to say about the staff.UITS help staff are very good--whenever I have had questions they have been able to help in a professional and competent manner."UITS products, however, are not so good--the new faculty reporting system that replaces the old FAR is pathetic. Far too many categories for each activity, most of which are either incomprehensible or irrelevant, forcing descriptors that are neither accurate nor comprehensive onto scholarly publications, lectures, and other activities. What a mess. Somewhere I've read that it is hoped that faculty will input their entire resumes and past years' FARs ... dream on.""As for IU secure--blah. I hate using my phone, and never have it where I need it. And carrying around a special jump drive is equally annoying. The result is that I now plan NOT to use smart classroom computers, just to avoid the annoyance. And speaking of which: it takes forever for one of those things to boot up, the touch screens leave students and faculty mystified, and the web browser opens to UITS--which is NEVER what I am looking for and makes it look like the University exists solely so that they can have their toys. Tail wagging the dog.""UITS is always patient, helpful and kind. I couldn't do my job without the help staff. Especially now with Canvas!"I do not like canvas in terms of ease of use or grade entering - even using speed grading - everything is clunky and increases my time spent on grading and entering grades as well as setting up the course each semester. I really dislike it and have been using it for a year before we were required to use it.I need to have access to my student rosters for years with pictures due to students coming back years later for letters of recommendation. Oncourse was used to a point and now I can't see those students pictures or grades so I can't help them by writing a letter of recommendation."Whenever I interact with an UITS staff on phone, it has always been very cordial and helpful. I also find the staff at Information Commons very helpful.""However UITS has plenty of scope to improve their staffing and overall attention to Residential Computer Labs, particularly the one at Evermann Apartments. It is embarrassing that a department that is famed for access, infrastructure and facilities across the campus is treating the residential labs so shabbily. They have the oldest computers, most aged scanner and worst room facility in the housing labs. I can say the same for Campus View. Please do not underestimate the huge number of patrons (and their frustration) that use these facilities.""While I know that some large and major units will need different, more industrial strength CMS systems, I wish that IU provisioned (IU template/branded) WordPress universally for smaller units to use and for individual faculty/researchers to use for personal work sites."Wireless access outside of campus buildings isn't great.**I no longer receive info about the number of pages left on my printing quota; this was very helpful & I wish this service had not been discontinued."**Come to think of it, I have not received an e-newsletter from UITS recently either. Why was this discontinued?""**First floor Wells UITS staff service has improved greatly, but it is still uneven. Staff members should never tell patrons ""I don't know,"" but instead should try to find out something or point patrons in the direction of someone who does know. They should wear name badges to be held accountable."**Overall campus computer centers could be MUCH cleaner please.**School of Education library computers are a mess now that [IRD] (dedicated staff) are gone. They're always down. Please bring the service back to the level it was when the two of them were at IU!*I work on all campuses - Kokomo library computers are great and so is the helpdesk!* The helpdesk at the IMU is great too - often not staffed enough.* My desktop PC's at IUPUI shuts down often during high winds/bad weather.* Would love to see ONE video conferencing system. Seems like no two rooms have the same set up. * Video connectivity is with our team of 20 is VERY frustrating. UITS protocol for communicating breaches has come a long way in the right direction over the past 5 years - Way to go!!!All my calls for IT support have been positive. The staff on the line helped me trouble shoot and helped me solve whatever issue I called to fix. I've really appreciated this assistance.All of my experiences with the Executive IT Services staff at the CIB and in Bryan Hall have been wonderful.All of my experiences with UITS have been very positive. I work with both the Exec IT group and HelpNet and have truly enjoyed working with them.Answers within a day.Appreciate the efforts of UITS [IRD] and his staff to help VPCPF with setting our staff up for the duo authentication.Are there live demos of the technology that we have access to with Q & A sessions? This would be great to see more of in newsletters from UITS and other communications so we know where and when to attend. Even remote demos would be advantageous for all users."As a general comment, I greatly appreciate working in this environment. The changes in tech seem more rapid than usual and I believe due to security threats. I've noticed co-workers struggling to keep up - I direct to knowledge base when I lack answers and always see it as the first line of information."As a risk manager I have to say that the phone system that requires you to be logged on and active to have phone connection constitutes a very high risk in the event of a disaster. This is especially dangerous in the case of work place violence or an active shooter. I feel that at the very minimum all front office staff and areas that can be used as 'safe' rooms should have hardwired phones."As an internal user of a wide array of UITS services, I can say that overall there are many caring, useful people representing UITS. My issues are usually situations where cross communication internal to UITS is not the best - too many silos."Many of these questions applied to services I didn't know were available to me (i.e. training)."At times the computer support staff in my building (IMU) are over-worked, and I think under-staffed.""Before I read this survey, I received no communication at all that OneStart would be decommissioned, so that was a surprise. When will the change take place? Why the change? What is the replacement to be? How to learn of these changes that I don't receive?""Appreciate the DUO system, although it wasn't explained (and I'm still unsure?) when I will be texted to use it and when I won't. What's the criteria? If it pops up, I ""duo.""""I asked the consultant on the telephone how to set an appointment to meet in person with a consultant in Wells Library - Bloomington. I was told ""they're always in."" I asked again that I wanted to set an appointment for Canvas help. Again, I was told no appointment as ""they're always here."" After I went across campus at 9:30 AM and chunked money in the library parking meter on a weekday, I learned that they ""are not always in."" Give your telephone people a resource as an option that they can set an appointment for a caller at the time that the solution is beyond the telephone consultant's ability to resolve the problem.""Better replacement cycle for computers in STC labs, some of the hardware is old and running very slow with Windows 10. "-Should probably rethink the durability of the Ricoh printers. The one closest to where I work is always breaking down. Don't know that they are made to withstand the amount of constant use."-Printing is difficult to understand, especially when printing from a laptop. "-KB could be clearer for a user when trying to set up their laptop for the very first time too. (I've tried to help people with it)"-Don't think the thin clients were a good investment, should rethink that and probably not do it again."-I work in a library that partners with UITS and ended up having to have the thin clients removed from our space because they couldn't get them to recognize our library print queues. What a disaster that whole thing was for us."-I do have to say that the STC folks who fix issues are prompt, reliable & great at their jobs. Kudos to them."-Same thing for the CTS people. Kudos to them."-We changed out our analog phone this year and I am thankful to the Unicom ladies who walked me through the process of setting up our group account and getting our voice mail set up . They were patient, kind and willing to help.""-UITS has some very good people working for them, I certainly hope they are not taken for granted."-Kudos to the consultant who helped me with DUO after I had changed phones. It's working great for me."Bryan Hall EITS guys are the best. Always helpful, knowledgeable, and provide very pleasant service."Calls to UITS have been positive. People seem to go out of their way to get the answer if they do not know it right away. The students who work in the Library support center are wonderful. I always get my problems solved.Phone- which you could increase the sound; the head sets do no hold their charge well.I put no for focus group because I am not very tech savvy- if you need someone like that I would help."I would like to see repeat classes, as with a work schedule you can not always take the time away- and then you have to wait a long time- I do realize you are busy- just wanted you to know I like the classes when I can fit one in."EITS supports our office and does a very nice job."Every interaction I have with any of the people from UITS is great. Your people are so polite and professional. I have said it before and I will keep on saying it, the people in your office are amazing and patient.""Every time I've called I've had a positive experience. That said, working with towers vs a laptop /docking station model has been a big change for me personally - not necessarily a bad thing to not bring work home, but also not quite as flexible as I've been used to in corporate.""File storage solutions are not very well ""advertised"". Besides departmental servers, I really don't know how to store/share files. ""The ""monitor"" seems to be more for techies and students rather than general staff/faculty users. More tips and tricks regarding phone services/Skype/general storage solutions/iuware apps/mobile computing with tablets would be interesting & helpful.""Folks are generally pleasant, efficient, and able to solve the problem no matter what you ask them or when. Extended hours are appreciated. Walk in service is great when you need to show them what your machine is doing. Liked having folks come out to various sites on campus to help get Duo added and up and running. Love the free token backup login option for Duo systems.""Kuali is ornery to deal with and logging in hours worked is time consuming and cumbersome. Software is not user friendly and not well explained. SIS is difficult to use. Searching for classes requires many steps and these frequently have to be redone if you want to go back and check something. Canvas can be tricky to find what your looking for and the dashboard display is awkward. I'd like to add more tiles to the screen and move them around to correspond to the different roles that I have on campus. Signing up for career advising appointments requires scrolling down and checking lots of boxes. Can we figure out something else? ORA it is just awful. No IT support at all for my work group. It took nearly a week to get my IU-assigned computer back up and running and three guys to figure out why I was locked out of ADS when I changed my password. They did way too much of saying nobody was assigned to support my group and not enough of ""Get me back online so I can do my job with the equipment the university assigned me to do it with.""""Need a helpline for the big machines (Karst, BigRed). My scripts would fail and the email notifications would not get sent out so that I could go back in and edit my job and submit again. Need KBs for the big machines as well. Nothing out there with graphics, basic commands, etc. for new users to get up to speed with. You're dependent on some other user telling you what you need to know and how to troubleshoot when things go wrong. That's not helping students stay in STIM when their first experience is more frustrating and time consuming than it needs to be.""For the first time in three years, my workgroup's data line to the bunker at the bypass did not get disrupted over Spring Break. Incredibly painful to not have access to systems you need because it takes a week to reestablish services because folks are saying ""that shouldn't happen"". Um, yeah it did. Now how do we fix it so we can get back to work? ""Overall UITS does a good job and I've found them to be helpful, patient, persistent and caring under trying circumstances.""Footprints, as implemented, could be better. The acknowledgements result in duplicate email messages. It creates more messages than should be required.""For the most part, my interactions with UITS have been positive. I have enjoyed the various different training classes I have taken through UITS, the way they are structured, and the fact that you seek feedback on them immediately and adjust accordingly. There have, of course, been those times where I contact UITS for help with something and either get an extremely delayed response, or get rather rudely told to contact someone else. These are less common, but still occur.""Generally, I'm really happy with the services UITS offers! The only two areas in which I would be happy to see an improvement are in some wireless network coverage gaps in the RTVS building and the Android interface for IU Mobile. It doesn't handle Kuali Time well at all."Great support from LSP Services as usual. [IRD] in particular doing great work.Support from office@iu.edu could be a little better (slow response).Wireless network access in SRSC could use strengthening (sometimes have to switch to LTE)."I always go away a happy customer in my dealing with UITS, but I am a little concerned about the "focus on security issues and how it would impact my freedom to configurecomputer hardware."I always have a good interaction with [IRD] when I have questions regarding IUIE data group problems, or how tables are built. I appreciate his attentiveness and his quick responses to my questions.""I always talk to someone who's friendly and supportive, and nearly always resolve the issue I have."I am a newer employee. A technology on boarding for IT pros would be helpful. There is a lot of information to absorb and navigating and finding the correct resources has been challenging. Some policies seem unnecessarily complicated and out of touch with practical day to day operations.I am served by EITS and they are wonderful."I am very pleased with the services provided by UITS. While my interactions are limited, I take that as a good sign."I appreciate the help that UITS staff gives.I called the center to speak to the rep. who had just emailed me to call him. A woman spent 20 minutes looking for him and then told me they had no one working there by that name which is not true since he emailed me again today!!I can speak only of positive experience with UITS staff and services. In this specific survey I do want to single out [IRD] and his colleagues for smoothing our transition from manual management to SCCM management. His entire team was available as needed for helping me and my team through that transition."I consider taking this survey a negative UITS experience because you don't give up until I take it. The emails are personalized, making me feel observed and harassed. I don't trust that I could choose not to take the survey without consequences, and I suspect my privacy will broken. I'm taking this survey grudgingly."I do not feel I've used the services enough to provide the input you need.I don't interact often with UITS staff as the School of Informatics and Computing has their own tech support team.I don't like that my phone only works when I'm logged into my computer...missed a few calls this way.I find it helpful to chat with UITS online since I'm not able to call or come in person during most of the day."I find the people who staff the help desks to be incredibly helpful, as are our library IT staff. I also really appreciate the classes you offer. I do wish you'd consider offering more advanced classes and especially more long-term classes, with homework, where we could have the opportunity to practice and get feedback."We've been looking for an advanced class in Word macros and VBA for years. Any help finding resources on that would be greatly appreciated."We are constantly having meltdowns with Outlook in our department that causes us to miss important emails or send emails that get stuck in the outbox. We can get around this by using the web app, but I don't see why this has been a lingering issue."Lync is a nightmare. I'm always missing calls and the phone will suddenly go dead. I have a brand new computer and I've read the very sparse support info. "Overall though, I feel so privileged to have access to the technology and support at IU. Thank you!""I have always been a big user and supporter of WordPress and I'd be happy to see much more support and enthusiasm for this platform at IU. Many Universities are leveraging WordPress as their primary website infrastructure and here at IU yet it seems to always get discouraged/pushed away in favor of Hannon Hill Cascade Server. WordPress can be implemented securely and successfully as proven by many institutions like Boston University and University of Washington. Even with the new HHCS ""Framework"", HHCS is not as approachable/usable as WordPress on Webserve and it seems many departments and groups would like to use WordPress (Media School, Medical School, Research Groups, etc.). If nothing else, much more support and coordination between HHCS and WordPress would be very helpful and useful."I have chatted online several times with the UITS help desk staff. Have always been very helpful.I have had a great experience with all IT staff. [IRD] in particular has been outstanding!I have had great experiences working with any issue I have had. Very prompt service."I have had NUMEROUS positive experiences with UITS. The only issues I have had are related to not having support in our building. While we have wonderful IT staff with such positive attitudes who get to us as quickly as possible, it is often difficult when they are pulled in many different directions and have a trip either across campus or off campus to contend with. It would be very helpful to us if we had IT support in our on-campus building.""I have limited contact with UITS staff as I tend to communicate through my department's specific IT personnel. However on the occasions where I need help specifically from UITS, I have often found that I don't get direct answers and solutions take weeks or months to come up with."I have never had a negative interaction with the UITS staff. The system is another story.I have not had negative interactions with UITS staff or services. I have taken several of the IT Training courses and found those to be helpful. I would find it beneficial if IT Training continued to expand what software they provide these trainings on - having a session or two on Tableau would definitely be helpful."I have only been an employee for a short time so my responses reflect the last 6 months. During this time, the system I use has not been reliable...the phone doesn't come on at times on a regular basis, the laptop does not transfer the image over to my desktop, Outlook doesn't load at times, and my screens, just recently, have been locking up. Oftentimes, I have to shut down the system a couple of times when I initially log on to get things working. And sometimes, they still don't work. I appreciate the continued trouble shooting services provided but it gets a little frustrating to have had these problems on a consistent basis. Therefore, my responses reflect this frustration. Is it possible to get a new system to use that's consistent, and move the trouble-shooting to your department to determine the problems with the various components of my system? This way, I could be more efficient and effective doing my work. Just a thought. Thank you."I have only had positive experiences with UITS. My only concerns are the recent declines in staffing that jeopardize the timeliness of responses."I have only one comment regarding IT training courses offered. The courses I see are for Excel and other desktop applications, which I don't consider IT, but I'm sure those courses fill a need. "I'm wondering if you offer training for network management or router configuration? I'm thinking CCNA but not quite that deep. Additional training in network management would be helpful in my position as a broadcast engineer.ThanksI have really enjoyed the UITS classes that I've attended and am grateful that these no longer have fees."I have responsibility for [IRD] computing resources across all campuses. I have to work with UITS units at each campus. While the individuals on each campus are helpful and cooperative, it is sometimes frustrating to have to try to coordinate with so many different units. It would be helpful to have all [IRD] resources centrally managed, in a single [IRD] OU, with centrally managed GPOs etc. Local UITS personnel from each campus could be granted admin rights over machines at their campus, so as to enable them to provide local support, while also maintaining central management.""I have struggled working with HelpNet since I started my position [IRD]. I have found that while there is a very quick response rate for the HelpNet employees when a ticket it submitted, oftentimes they are unable to fix the problem or provide a ""Band-Aid"" solution that causes things to worsen. For example, I was having trouble with multiple email accounts that are all linked to Outlook when I open it. Any emails I was sending from three different accounts, were showing up in my Sent folder for my personal account. I made sure to select the correct account in the ""From"" drop down, but it would never make a difference. This meant that we were unable to use our accounts in the intended manner, due to this technological issue. When a HelpNet employee responded, they stated that there was nothing that they could do -- even though there were other users in my office who had the accounts working properly. Another individual from HelpNet came later and stated that my account was set up incorrectly, and reformatted it so that the emails were sending properly, the same as every other user in my office. A few days later, the original employee came back to look at my account again and stated that my account was now set up incorrectly and reverted everything back to the way it was originally. This is not an unusual pattern -- I have found myself not calling HelpNet for assistance because I have found that there have been times when their assistance has made things worse and have caused more work for myself. ""Further, there is one HelpNet employee who comes to our office often who has been very dismissive of my concerns and unwilling to explain options further, focusing specifically on the one solution that he was willing to offer at the time. An example of this was when I was concerned about being asked to log into our kiosk iPads with my personal username and passphrase. I fully understand why this is needed, however, I wanted to consult with my supervisor first to determine who would be the appropriate person to enter their credentials. When I asked for more information to explain to my supervisor the situation, he placed the iPads down on the desk in a flippant manner and then said, ""Call me when you and [INSERT NAME] figure it out."" He then left the office. Another example is when he got into a heated argument with an employee in our office because the employee in our office felt like the HelpNet employee was saying that the issues were operator error, when she specifically documented the issue she was experiencing. While this was a two-way argument - and it is not the sole responsibility of one party, it was a moment about HelpNet services that caused tension and awkwardness within our work environment .""I have utilized the walk-in UITS service at the Wells Library to add money to my IU staff ID card so I can print at the Student Technology center computer labs. The UITS people at Wells have been helpful. I work for the [IRD], so for work-related technology issues, I contact CITO first (not UITS). I would like to learn more about how to utilize Wi-Fi services on campus, using my Smart Phone (Android)."I like the new KFS dashboard and find one.iu.edu easy to use as well. I appreciate the information you share about phishing issues and other things that are going on.I love the Knowledge Base. It is fantastic."I love UITS! The breadth of services from training (both online and in person), software (IUanyware rocks!!) and reliability of internet speeds is amazing!""I love UITS. They are always friendly, patient and helpful.""I might have called UITS once this year; if so, they helped me rapidly and effectively! Normally, I ask CITO for help since I am employed by the [IRD]. They, too, are excellent. When you ask my satisfaction with Microsoft Exchange/Outlook/Outlook Web Application: I love Outlook and I HATE Outlook Web App (so much so that I only use it in extreme need). The Lync/Skype phone system is OK but TOO DIFFICULT to transfer calls; I can do it but others in my office have a lot of trouble. iGPS Course Search is too deeply layered, i.e. I have to drill down very far (many clicks) to find out if a course is still open. I much MUCH prefer the old SIS Course Search and REALLY hope you don't EVER take that away from us advisors. It is SO much faster.""I needed to purchase a new cell phone after I had already registered an old phone with Duo, and it would have been beneficial to have clearer instructions on how to walk me through the process.""I rarely interact with the staff, so I have no comments. As for the services, I use them everyday and have no complaints.""I really haven't had any issues that has brought the need to communicate directly with UITS. In general, I've not had any problems with IU technology. My only comment would be that IU Secure would connect a little better in places such as Memorial Stadium and the parking lot around the stadium on game days. It has seemed to have gotten better however."I so appreciate that if I have issues on my home computer I can phone and get assistance to do my work at home.I think the most prominent issue I face is the lack of coordination and cooperation between CITO and UITS. As a staff member of a unit within the College it is endlessly frustrating to be shuttled back and forth from CITO to UITS and vice versa for issues when neither is sure who should take responsibility for resolving the problem. There are occasions when the two support teams need to work together and they rarely ever do so efficiently or smoothly.I think the services are performed very well. I have always had help right away. Issues were solved quickly. Thank you for your support."I think the UITS help desk is fabulous, in 20 years I have consistently experienced success with these individuals and they remain unrattled in their approach, patient, kind, and resourceful. This speaks to the training they receive as they take on this challenge.""The knowledge base is a great tool, but frequently it is written from a technical perspective, not a user perspective who can't understand or has no knowledge about the system framework or vocabulary terms used within the knowledge base. I think it would help to have the language redone to consider that perspective, adding, less technical terms in ( ) would go along way. Finally, adding pictures of what the screens might look like would also help. Recently, a co-worked couldn't comprehend how slashtmp worked and I couldn't understand the instructions completely either, but due to my background, I was willing to play with the system, using my double monitors, I had instructions up and tried various options using my gmail to see how it worked, then I print screened the steps as they occurred interspersing and re-writing the Knowledge base instructions so they were more first-time user friendly. I do this from my ""educator"" framework.""Overall, I think UITS does a tremendous job, keeping so many systems ready to go for thousands with an eye on possible hacks, security threats, and capacity and use of system constantly. I am grateful everyday for the systems your provide as I hum along, navigating many features everyday! Thanks so much and keep up the good work!""I think the UITS staff does a great job, sometimes they are a little slow to respond but then again, it is a big university. The one service that I am deeply disappointed in is the ability that we once had to purchase software as an employee for a discounted rate. It was super nice to buy accounting or book keeping software...etc."I understand the importance of security but there needs to be a balance between too much security that does not allow us to complete our jobs.I usually have very positive interactions with UITS."I am usually using HPC system for my bioinformatics research projects. If UITS HPC team had more computing scientists or senior computing engineers who are not only strong in computing hardware and software but also strong in both structural bioinformatics and genomic bioinformatics, we could then seek deeper and more broaden services or help from UITS in our research projects. I am satisfactory that UITS have a strong team in HPC system and software maintenance. The team always provides right or alternative solutions for my questions.""I utilize the tech folks in our building frequently and they are wonderful! I have used some of the software that we can get from IUWARE, and that's about it. The lynx system SLOWS down job function for those who have to transfer phone. Instead of an instant process it take 30+ seconds to do it...very frustrating."I was disappointed when Lynda.com was cancelled and was one of the people who used it quite a bit. It was very useful and wish we still had access to it.I was hired as a [IRD]. I've had very positive experiences with UITS. I got help setting up my email on my phone and getting a token for the Duo two-step login.I went to the UITS help desk at the Wells Library just last week for help with my Droid phone dropping the IU secure network. The person I spoke with blamed IU Secure and was not really able to help me. He just dismissed my problem saying there was nothing he could do.I wish there was a way to turn off the graphics on One.IU and instead just see the choices listed alphabetically."The migration from SP2010 and Nintex workflows to SP Online and K2 Appit has been stressful and frustrating. There needs to be more individual contact and assistance, and more prompt responses when questions are asked.""I work in RPS and work through our AIT staff, who then will refer a work request to UITS as/if needed. The process is satisfactory."I work in the Wells library and have had good experiences whenever I ask the UITS folks in the lobby for help.I'm also always impressed with the 855-6789 help line.And the Knowledge Base is usually helpful."I work with financial systems and have used a token to access systems for years. When DUO came about, I added my cell phone to be able to access my personal data from home. The system now defaults to my cell for authentication and I would prefer that it default to my token. In a chat with UITS, they told me that the token was never meant to be the main tool for access. The token has been my only source for years. And now, some people are only using a token, no secondary. If some can have only a token, I think I should be able to make my token my default.""I worry about security. I have had some very strange things occur while working on the pc I am assigned. I am not one to open suspicious emails, etc. and I certainly do NOT share any of my passwords or account(s) information. Local IT professionals thought things to be serious enough to replace the hard drive this past year a few months prior to our replacement cycle, but the oddities have kept occurring. I wonder if there is some sort of internal problem ...?"I would like an online tutorial or in-person workshop about how to use Facebook. Also a tutorial about iTunes."If there is some kind of campus-wide outage or problem e.g. Outlook not working, it would be great to be kept informed of the situation (e.g. has the problem been reported, is it being addressed)."If we could get advance notice of system changes it would help us get things set up . Like when mail service was down and res. cards . This would have been a lot smoother for us and the HA's if we could have prepared for this."In general I do not think UITS or UISO provide the necessary volume of resources and guidance to departments concerning their individually respective internet presence. Many units pay resources outside of IU to develop their web pages. Usually because it is less expensive to hire externally than be charged by IT for the services. This is unfortunate and should be changed. It's 2017, all departments are on the internet. Are they all safe? Who knows...because I don't think anyone in IT or Security is watching. Are all systems patched, updated timely, and running anti-virus? No they are not. It's IT policy that they should be but IT does not proactively investigate and enforce their own policies.""In general my experiences with UITS have been positive and helpful. The issues I have most often do not have to do with UITS--at least I don't think they do. I'm under the [IRD] and I think RSTS doesn't allow us to do enough--for example, I can't download IU approved fonts or calibrate my monitor without RSTS assistance. If this is under your purview, PLEASE change it!""In my experience, UITS has always been top notch. I am grateful for the helpfulness and high level of expertise."Is it normal for me to have to restart my desktop computer at least once and often two times each day? This is usually because Outlook and Skype will not work."IT Support in my building is excellent, particularly [IRD]. He is extremely talented, professional, and courteous.""I know this is probably not practical given the size of the campus, but I wish we had Wi-Fi outside.""It would be helpful for someone from UITS to follow up to confirm when something has been activated or a project has been completed. While it's okay to be given an expected time frame for completion (i.e. within 3 business days), it makes it difficult to know what happened if the activation or project doesn't appear to have worked."IU Anyware is a very useful tool you have provided. I like having software available without needing to install it. It is very useful for times when I only need certain pieces of software occasionally."The degree map page is very buggy. It seems to have a timeout period, but it is not indicated by any sort of message. It simply stops being able to search or save. It is also very un-intuitive to use. It pulls too many courses (it shows current term and unscheduled courses) and students and advisors do not immediately know how to filter. Overall, it is a very clunky system.""The IT Pro communications are very well done, but it often seems like important messages to end users get lost in other information like the monitor. For many in my area, they were unaware of Lync 2010's retirement until the week before it was to be retired. This may seem like it should be the work of the local ITPro group, but they were not proactive in this situation in communication or execution. ""I also do not always know the best place to communicate issues about various systems. If I have problems with IUIE, or SIS it is unclear the best place to address those. I have a similar problem with degree map, which lists 3 different email address to direct questions to. ""Overall, I very much like and appreciate the services UITS provides. It has excellent front line, good how-to documentation, a reliable VPN, and I find most provided services easy to use. Thank you!""I've always gotten quick resolutions to issues I've reported. Now that I'm at the end of the survey, it would be nice to see a progress bar of some sort."I've had several chances to work with the UITS folks and I've always found those experiences pleasant and helpful.Kaltura Mediaspace - Having it seems like a needed service and very welcomed. Using it in the past I have noticed performance issues when trying to view videos which has discouraged proactive use of it."Tier 2 support - Most of the time we have direct access to the individuals that actually do the work we need done. On occasion we go through the central help desk. I am sure they are trying to be helpful, but in my experience it seems they try to solve problems that are beyond their skill and knowledge. Instead they become the middle man creating noise during the conversation which overly complicate the problem. After initial engagement I would prefer working directly with those who will be resolving the issue."Additional items - adding additional self service capabilities would be welcomed.Most of the questions were answered."Most services I know of and use are clicking along amazingly well. Hardware in some STC rooms is getting long in the tooth. IUAnyware is amazing when not too many are using it, it slows down a lot by mid-semester. Interface to cloud storage gets particularly slow. ""I would like to see support for Onedrive and Google drive to be considered secure. I find their functionality and speed greater than Box. (They're both better capitalized, I imagine.) ""I'm sure you're well aware IU Secure slows down and begins to frustrate students. Student oriented social media becomes a litany of complaint about it around mid-semester, and finals time. ""Having to use Pulse Secure rather than built-in VPN options is slow and painful. Particularly frustrating to have to toggle apps on phones between Wi-Fi, Pulse, and Duo, all just to get connected for a short time somewhere in the world, on slow Wi-Fi.""(I totally understand and agree with the need for this level of security... I'm just expressing a hope that we can get back to OS-vendor-supported, built-in options someday.)""I would also like to see Google Authenticator as an option in addition to Duo, for n-factor authentication. It would also be nice to find a vendor for inexpensive Duo-capable token generators, in case of loss/theft of smartphones, and to be able to generate a short list of single-use tokens in case of loss of all devices. Especially in today's environment of increased device-confiscation at border crossings. :(""Music ITS is a dedicated, hard working group. Thank you!""My answers were concerning my limited exposure to UITS, as since I work in the Office of Research Administration, I find that I use the services of RASD and RSTS to handle any immediate needs. My one overall frustration would be concerning when I am working on a project that needs IT development, and am told that there is such a backlog of work, it would be 2 to 3 years to begin any phase that involves programming. If there is that much demand for the time of our programmers, why are we unable to simply hire more people? I do appreciate all the help that the various IT teams have provided, and need to mention that the people I have worked with have always been kind, professional, and driven to solve any issues in an timely manner.""My experience on this instance was very good. The technician was prompt, courteous, and efficient."My experiences are always satisfactory.N/ANoneNone."Not completely dissatisfied with anything, but there is room for improving all of it.""Most of my problems stem from not enough training when something new is coming out, or an upgrade goes in, and then I feel like it's up to me to learn how to use it, which I generally don't feel like I have enough time to do."Zoom is the most recent example."Not enough log in ""keys"" for everyone who wants one for Duo."Nothing but nice things to say about IT both in my department and when I've had to access services at the library.On most issues the person I talk to can fix the issues we are having. Other times it takes a while to get results."On the rare occasion I've had to call in from home, your staff has been very polite and helpful.""On the rare occasions when I've needed to call for support, I've gotten quick and effective assistance. I very much appreciate the availability and usability of services such as IUware, IUanyWare, and Box. Overall, I feel like the resources available to us remain timely and up-to-date. The only recurring issues for me have been outages that affect Exchange/Outlook connectivity, which is central to my work.""One comment on IU Secure: during my busy season, I work long days. IU Secure will kick me off after so many hours (not exactly sure how many) and I have to log into the system again. This is problematic and worrisome, as I want to be certain my documents are being auto saved on my network."One of the only reasons that I am completing this survey is because I want to make sure that as many people as possible know how awesome the Kelley UITS technical support is. I don't know to what extent the Kelley technical people are connected to UITS but they are amazing and amazingly helpful. They always respond quickly; they never make you feel stupid or as if you are asking a simple question that most people would be able to figure out."Our department is a CIC system user and it would be very helpful to have better training on how to use this system to it's potential. To those of us that are not technical-minded, help documentation is rarely helpful."Our UITS team is the best ever!!! :O)I have always had patient & experienced service. :O)"Over the 17 years I've been at IU, UITS has improved greatly at being customer focused (for example, this survey). Recently, I've been involved with video conferencing and the UITS staff who handle this are really great! I especially appreciate all that UITS is doing to keep the IU network safe and secure... although I frequently wish I still had admin rights to the computer I use every day."Overall experience has been good.Overall I think UITS is very good - better than other places I have worked."Overall I've been happy with all of my experiences with UITS. Whenever I needed a new computer set up or had an issue with outlook or an add-in, they responded promptly and were able to locate the problem quickly."Overall the services and assistance provided by UITS has been very satisfactory."Overall, a good experience.""Overall, I am generally happy with my interactions with UITS. I have no complaints.""Overall, I'm generally satisfied with most services. I am not satisfied, however, with departmental web support. There is very little or no support for departments without specific IT positions. The rest of us muddle through as best we can. However, when I try to access resources in regards to web publishing, I often run across outdated and inaccurate information (as I later find out) still online or, even worse, in the Knowledge Base. Please update these resources."Positive experiences with UITS staff - always found them to be willing to help in a very timely manner."Recently I emailed about a problem - I couldn't figure out how to set up the push notifications for Duo, because I already had text message notifications set up. Email replies didn't make sense, so I called and a staff person talked me through it. On the phone, he understood why it wasn't working (I wasn't starting from scratch - my phone was already in there). Not a big deal, but it was irritating that I was being emailed instructions that I had just followed on the UITS Duo website, that didn't work. ""I work at Kelley and our KSBIT staff are our main source for IT help. In fact, when I needed to send a phishing attempt, I IM'd one of our KSBIT staff to ask for the email (I was close, but had the extension wrong)."I usually only use UITS for issues to do with campus things (Duo) rather than things at my computer or desk.Services for the phone system seem to be incredibly slow and unresponsive.Persistent Outlook issues are getting very tiresome."The new Duo is cumbersome. If I'm bouncing between systems, I may have to two-factor several times a day. It seems strange that it does not recognize a frequently used machine. I have to answer too many questions from others who don't know how to use it.""Since I am in the COAS, a lot of these questions did not apply to me.""SIS is a pretty outdated and bug-ridden system. It is by far my biggest overall frustration in working for the university, and needs an overhaul.""Skype for business isn't as good as Lync was from a user standpoint. However, it doesn't crash as often as Lync did. I don't like how difficult it is to manage my contacts. It would be nice to see the user interface updated for all of the administrative services we use. An iPhone app to manage ePTO that works well and looks good on mobile and on laptop would be great. I'm continually frustrated with the WCMS because you have to expand EVERYTHING to see where you are on the page and to add or edit content. It was easier in the old version to see everything because the boxes didn't need to be expanded. "I've not had any issues with any staff."Also, I have a HIGH volume of spam messages going into my inbox. I've created rules, and a lot of them now go to junk, but I am still receiving many of them in the inbox. I have hundreds in my junk folder over a weekend. I don't feel like the IU junk censors are doing a great job.""Some UITS groups are very disorganized and communicate poorly - in particular, it's difficult to get the correct information about teaching and learning pilot programs. Also, it seems like a lot of the pilot initiatives don't really meet user needs, which is frustrating. The support center is a mixed bag, depending on the consultant you get. IT Training is fantastic. The Skype/Lync people have terrible customer service and don't seem to know what they're doing.""Staff is always super friendly and helpful. They do seem to have issues with the plotter printers - it takes way longer than it should just getting things set up to print, but I appreciate having this as an on-campus service."Telecom requests do not get answered in a timely manner. I have had two requests in [IRD] that have virtually been ignored for weeks until I contact someone personally.The Casper service is critical to compliance with IT policy. If UITS wants departments to actually follow IT policy then this tool must be supplied to the university departments at no cost. SCCM and Active Directory are provided to departments at essentially no cost. Without Casper/Jamf we have no real way to actually be in compliance with IT policy."Research Technologies needs to do a much better job of telling departments and specifically researchers about services like Karst, IU GitHub and other central systems that can help researchers meet their needs. These systems also help with IT policy compliance by allowing researchers to use managed systems so they are not trying to manage their own servers outside of IT policy. UITS needs to do more in this area of supplying expertly run systems that departments can utilize for their research goals."IU Print for departments is a great thing but like other services you need to actually support that system and be more responsive to service requests and provide the cross platform configuration files and information through already established systems like IUware and the KB. Casper and SCCM are tools that should also be used for the distribution of IU Print configurations."The fact that the quality of basic IT support varies across campus (ExecIT vs. Helpnet, for example) drives me nuts. As nice as the Helpnet guys might be (And some of them are not at all nice and consider any questions to be a burden on their time), more often than not they're left to Googling solutions to basic IT issues. I've started just doing that on my own instead of bothering to make a request. At least that way I know no one will be rude to me.""The few times I have had to call UITS for help, everyone has been very helpful. I do at times have issues with getting connected to the wireless on campus. It would be nice if that didn't seem to be so difficult.""The important instructions for Lync/Skype telephone functions seem to change with every software revision and are not circulated. I have not been able to successfully transfer or merge a call since the first system upgrade. Instructions received at the time of adoption are no longer accurate, and no new instructions have been distributed. I don't know where to find them or who to ask.""The switch to IU Box (following OnCourse project site retirement) has been frustrating. Box is incredibly slow at my university workstation. There was no provision with OnCourse retirement to batch transfer files from the old system to a new system. Senior level staff and faculty end up spending hours of time in the mindless task of individually, manually downloading files from the system that is to be retired and uploading them to the new system if you don't give us an automatic batch conversion tool."The IT personnel internal to the School of Public Health are exceptional. They have assisted me with troubleshooting my work iPad and replacement. The wireless network in the basement of the School of Public Health building is sporadic. I cannot keep a steady connection on my smartphone or my laptop (MacBook Pro).This is distracting when I am in meetings and have to utilize the internet on my personal devices.The IT support staff in psychology are consistently wonderful!!"Internet has been a bit of a problem in certain areas of the psychology building (second floor, research labs hallway) and one wired computer losing connection periodically as well. This could be improved. "Sometimes emails (which I'm told were sent to me) do not come through to my inbox or are delayed in coming to my inbox. This poses a major inconvenience.The new two-step login is incredibly obnoxious and I hate that it is mandatory. I don't always have my phone available when I want to check my email on a computer. What if my phone dies when I am using a computer away from home? Guess I can't access IU services anymore!The on site service in Athletics is fantastic. The inability to email a link is inconvenient and I wish more emails went out explaining why and how to get around this problem and still send informative emails.I still don't know how to use my phone. Outlook is terrible. Please change to gmail. The duo process is inconvenient. Please get rid of that double step process. One.iu is still hard to navigate and keep my homepage with the items I need. The financial reimbursement system is a pain and not user friendly. It also takes too long to get reimbursed. Thank you."The One.iu.edu landing page makes me cringe. The organization seems totally random and it's difficult to find topics, requiring you to know the name of the system/program you need, rather than what it does. Plus, nothing is alphabetized! Please put the things in alpha order, and maybe allow a search by what you are trying to do (""enter time"") rather than the name of the system you need to use (who knows what Kuali is?).""The only concern I can think of to mention is the linking of my phone to my work station. While I understand the logic and financial reasoning behind this situation, the link has made my phone much less, rather than much more, functional.""I also have problems now with my mobile device and my IU e-mail account, but I'm not sure whether that problem--which surfaced with my ""upgrade"" to a new phone--is the fault of the service provider or new security protocols at IU. Even my in-house department IT guys couldn't get my phone to accept IU e-mail.""I guess I would also say I'm complacent about UITS services. I take them/it for granted, but suspect that when I step away from IU I will recognize how much service/protection they provide. So thank you for that!""The only concerns I have are with the slight aggravation related to updates on software like Skype, Adobe, and others that require admin rights and therefore I have to get UITS or ETS staff to take care of such a simple, yet persistent, issue.""The only real interaction I have had with IT is really the staff at IUHC. [IRD] and [IRD] are excellent, but only having one of these as full time is really a detriment to this facility. There are enough issues that could be covered full time by these two employees, and the load could be divided more evenly, resulting in a better work place. These two employees in particular are knowledgeable, considerate, and are a joy to work with, but they seem to have a lot on their plate that could be more evenly divided with more work hours allowed."The only snafu that happens regularly is silly and very minor: The transcription of IU Voice Mail messaging into our Outlook email never translates in any way close to the original message!!! It could easily be considered alien or an excellent source for comedians. Might we just get rid of that feature?!"The overall technical support is ok, but majority of the UITS Help Desks usually do not offer in-depth solutions to the posted problems. Instead those IT students usually refer everybody to search the Internet for the answers and possible solutions for the problem at hand. Not good. When I come to Help Desk to reach for help I don't want to be sent off to some other sources to look for a possible solution to my problem. That's what the Help Desk should be for. One more thing. When you come to Help Desk with a problem and are trying to describe it with your own words, the people at Help Desk expect for you to ""speak their IT language"". Otherwise they will not make any effort to try to ""translate"" the issue you are describing into the realm of pro IT language and terms. In other words, if you don't speak IT ""language"" you better stay away from the Help Desk for no real help is awaiting you there. Sad. Very sad. Waste of my time...."The phone system is the WORST. I get echoes in my calls regularly. Transferring process is getting worse instead of better. You can't relay/shorthand a customer's message to another department before transferring the customer - so they have to start over with a new department. Frustrating.The transition of my profile from IUPUI to IU has been rocky. The profile is attached to many things and I have been discovering them one-by-one."The UITS staff members have always been helpful and considerate, and well prepared to answer my questions.""The UITS staff that reside at the IUF that work with us at the IUAA are very helpful and very responsive. They are kind and we enjoy working with them. Outside of the staffing I do believe however that the Duo system is overkill, every single time you log in is inconvenient."My iPhone does not trust the wireless on campus now for some reason. It consistently says there is a security issue. Could this be due to the new security you have put into place? Not being able to use the Wi-Fi is disappointing."UITS in person support has been great, sometimes can be slow depending on availability."UITS has always been very helpful to me."UITS has always made computer/internet issues easy to correct, I have no problems with your support staff at all! ""There is one area I feel that could be improved on, although it is rather specific to myself and not to campus. I work in MSB2, and I believe that UITS and the SPEA BITS have two separate servers in MSB2, so all Ethernet ports are either UITS or SPEA BITS owned/operated. To make it even more confusing, I switched from one office (working as a [IRD]) to a nearby office as a [IRD] for a SPEA professor. I thought it was strange that SPEA and University networks had such a hard time communicating with each other (in a physical sense with computers/networks, all support staff on both sides are extremely helpful)."UITS has always worked hard to help and fix McNutt problems.UITS has been very helpful.I find having to have the token to sign in to most things rather annoying.UITS have always been very knowledgeable and helpful in resolving my issues."UITS is doing a good job, but I feel some units are understaffed, such as the SCCM group.""UITS is great! I love the consultants: they are always available, they are patient, they understand multiple platforms and are both creative and persistent in looking for solutions. I have a Chromebook, which has a different kind of interface, and I know it posed an initial challenge. Thanks to UITS, we've figured it out. "I could use better instruction on Lync. I just found out I can do groups!"My only minor criticism is in training. The courses offered are on point, and the program administration is good. The content delivery is uneven.""UITS is great! When our local LSP's don't know a solution to any problem, they call on UITS for the answer."UITS is so helpful as a department. Each person I've worked with has been amazing and so very helpful! One thought. Is there any way you can get better connections in Assembly Hall during games? The internet is so slow. I know there are so many people in there. Just wondering if there was a way to connect or speed up the ability to connect. Thanks! You guys are awesome!"UITS is terrific. Great responsiveness and personal service, especially for a group with as large a footprint as it has. The people are always very helpful, friendly and accommodating.""UITS keeps everyone working! UITS adds new services that improve and streamlines the way staff, faculty, and students work.""UITS supports the IT Edge people very well, and it is always very much appreciated.""The only thing I can think to add is that the IU Fax Service should respond to their tickets. We submit things through their website, but never receive a confirmation that it was sent, nor do we get confirmation that the work has been completed. It's awesome when the service does go into effect, but it would be nice to get notification from them in some format.""Other than that, with everything and everyone UITS has to work with and serve, they do a wonderful job! "Keep up the good work!UITS staff have been very helpful in figuring out any IT problems that I've had!Usually quick and efficient reps.Very happy with UITS services."We (my office) do not rely on UITS, typically. When I've contacted UITS, they have been able to assist. I just wish that we could pick passphrases on the computer instead of visiting in person to a UITS center."We need a safe location to store MANY passwords under ONE password. It would be good to work with Purchasing to get a contract vendor for this so that IU can provide depts. with this ability without having to pay an additional fee."The people answering the hotline (5-6789) and chats don't say I don't know often enough. Giving the WRONG information is bad; saying I don't know I can escalate this issue to get you some help is better. For example, a retired staff called the hotline and got the run around, was told she didn't need a Duo method to pull her W2, but since she RETIRED, she did need it. They also told her that she would not be able to set up a new Duo method since the token she had had while working was left in the dept. but not deactivated. [IRD] fixed the situation for us with good communications. I can only participate in focus groups during the work-day if my supervisor agrees (I haven't asked yet).""We need more IT resources for system enhancements and business needs. Also, it takes too long to get a security review completed."I find KB difficult to use.The live chat online function is great. I always get good service.I miss Lynda."When someone or something has hacked my account, I do appreciate that my passphrase is reset. However, sometimes it happens two or three times a year and I never know when it will happen. The result is that I may be suddenly shut out of just about every system that I use. Then, I have to walk to a campus consultant and prove who I am. Then, that person resets my passphrase and opens my account. By the time I get back to my computer, I'm locked out and I have to then call a consultant. Surely, there is an easier way for staff, especially IT staff to get back in after an incident like that. In general, the support is very helpful.""Within the employee portal and Outlook Web Access, there seems to be a security flaw where if two members of the same household are both employees, it sometimes holds the first user's information on the computer even when they have logged out of the system. Only solution seems to be to go to a different web browser. For example, seeing the first person's employee data on pop-up screens even after re-logging in with the second user's credentials."Would love to see more resources to help administrative departments with Business Intelligence projects for the good of IU administrative decision support."All issues I have had they have told me are external vendor issues. I would say that either means they're doing a great job, or everything important is outsourced.""Brought my computer into UITS at Wells because it was slow, and a member of your staff downloaded software that my computer did not support and I was unable to get past the login screen for almost a week. Then took it back and a different member got me back up and running, but my computer was easily twice as slow as when I originally brought it in, it's borderline unusable now. "Please make sure your staff are more careful and knowledgeable.Canvas has been having outages lately."Knowledge Base can be very confusing, but helpful if you keep digging for information.""Canvas is clunky and doesn't allow me the freedom in grading that Oncourse did. I've been working with various IU systems for [IRD] years and it seems like each of these shifts add some new tools, but take away some very important ones. It would be great if we could give feedback before these big changes occur.""The Duo system is extremely inconvenient and doesn't make me feel any safer. The frustrations of not being able to log in because I don't have my phone with me that day are immense, and can have serious impacts on my ability to teach. I've taken to having to put all my class materials up on a non-IU webpage just so I can be guaranteed the ability to reach it if my phone battery dies or I leave it at home some days.""Canvas is terrible, and seems to be getting worse.""It at least used to automatically run submitted papers through Turnitin, but now I have to load an obnoxious external tool that doesn't work properly when it comes to actually downloading my students papers for review, checking originality reports, etc.""There is no way, that I know of, to associate a lecture class with its individual discussion sections. I'm sure there are differences of opinion on exactly how to structure such a connection, but at the very least I should be able to identify which students in the lecture class are associated with which section, sort their assignments appropriately, etc.""The email system through Canvas is a disaster. At least half of the time I do not receive attachments that my students try to send me through the Canvas email system. Sometimes I don't get their emails at all (although that may just be them not really sending them when they say that they do). When I respond through Umail to a canvas message, Canvas does not register that I have read the email, and so I have alerts that I have new messages until I open canvas and open the message itself, and even then the alert only goes away about half the time, or it goes away only when I receive a new alert, which means I don't know whether I actually have a new email from a student or am just being told that I have a new email that I have in fact already responded to."Duo login is a hassle--could there be a way to only require it for a select few IU sites that conceal highly personal information or allow each person a code to use for a set period of time rather than requesting a new one every single login?"DUO Login is awful, it is a waste of time for every application. I understand for sensitive information such as my tax, pay stubs, etc. But requiring DUO for everything is not only a hassle but provides no benefit."Duo login is inconvenient. The instructions on how to connect the duo app to your phone so you don't have to get a call after you have matched duo to your phone is unclear and doesn't work for people who have already linked duo on their phones and forgot to download the app. It is already really annoying that our passwords have to be very long. Canvas is not mobile friendly."Faster computers, faster network, less use of Duo for all Canvas logins.""First, the negative. I have noticed that none of the IT interfaces for any electronic service the university offers is either intuitive or user-friendly. On the contrary, I have found all of them to be quite convoluted, laden with technical jargon, ill-organized, and obviously oriented towards an IT audience's use, instead of a student audience's. For any actually useful applications of the systems, I have had to rely on either fellow student word of mouth or time-costly trial and error. Even the IT presentation I received as part of my orientation was obviously an afterthought for the presenter, who was required to present SOMETHING to the students, but who nevertheless neglected to introduce himself, quickly glossed over things that seemed to have been possibly critical to functioning within the digital environment of IU, and who also spoke entirely in his own dialect of IT throughout. I have discussed my IU IT experiences with fellow students and found them to not be isolated. In short, IU's IT resources are prodigious and offer AMAZING services, but getting to those services seems like a form of Machiavellian torture made more darkly comical because we are forced to rely on them to function here. By the way, I work for the [IRD], so I understand better than most the exact nature of that construct! ""Now, the positive: ""I could not access my email and, after running into walls gaining access by using the system's not-so-helpful online instructions, and after then fortunately receiving detailed instructions from a friend who had experienced the same thing, I found the UITS desk and had an excellent interaction with the two agents there. They quickly and politely resolved my issue and even seemed genuinely pleased that the issue was resolved. They were awesome."Friendly and helpful. Obviously there are limitations on what UITS can do with hardware but their advice has been very sound and educative."From when I started at IU about 6 years ago, IU Secure has improved tremendously.""Generally, good so far.""Hardware, scanners. At non-IU campuses I've had access to and used top-down image capture ""scanners"" that are self-contained units (no messing with programs on an attached computer). You hold or lay the book open, press a touch screen or foot-pedal to capture the image, then it crops the image for you and separates it into the two distinct pages of the book. You can compile a file this way then save it to a usb or email. Makes it much easier and faster to scan lengthy articles and books, which I frequently do for my graduate research. Would love access to a machine of this type.""I am a distance learner, so many of these questions did not apply to me."I am an online student and have not had any experiences with IT staff. It would be great if you had more Google Tools like LucidChart available for students.I am satisfied with most of the UITS services. UITS has been able to help me several times in the past and it was always a pleasant experience. The only aspect that I think could be improved is the class registration website - it's not always intuitive. Thank you for providing information technology services on campus - it's very helpful.-[IRD]"I appreciate the role of UITS, the updates provided on the Listserve, the online courses available for basic skills such as Excel, and assistance."I can't get on IU secure since being forced to change my password. It's very annoying. It's on me though to see IT so it's not necessarily your fault.I don't know why I often get 1+ phishing email and fake emails per week from IU or mail"I found the notification about two-step login to be way overdone, but the actual instructions for setting up and especially activating it to be lacking. Also, instructions for how to set up the VPN were clear, but very challenging to find in the first place.""I had issues for [IRD] years trying to connect my phone, computer, and other device to the IU intranet/Wi-Fi. My repeated calls and inquiries were given to entry level workers and nothing was done besides giving me nonsensical excuses. ""It is just your computer. It is because you are using windows 7. It is because you are using windows 8 (after switching). You are not listed as a student. Are you sure you are a student? We don't have any record of you having any issues in the past"" This has negatively impacted my education as I depend on this technology to treat patients on a daily basis. My account was finally fixed (meaning it worked some of the time) my final semester. I would discourage other students from IU professional programs based on this experience."I have all the positive experiences with UITS."I have almost no experience with UITS staff or services, unless downloading software through IU Any Ware counts. Sometimes IU Secure does not work very effectively at my office in Ballantine Hall.""I have found the software on IUWare most helpful because it has saved me time and money figuring out which anti-virus software or which version of Microsoft Word to purchase. I do not necessarily have the best computer software knowledge, so it was helpful to have a few options supported by IU all in one location.""I find Canvas a lot easier to navigate in comparison to Oncourse, but I do miss the messaging feature on Oncourse that separated the messages in my inbox by class section. On Canvas, all the messages are lumped in one inbox which is slightly annoying. One of the best features of Canvas is the fact that it lists what assignments are due and which ones are coming up. The calendar of assignments helps to keep me organized.""As you have probably already heard countless complaints about, I do not understand why I need duo login for every application even as an IU employee. I understand having it for financial records, but do I really need it for Canvas? All I want to do is check to see if the professor put up the assignment portal, and I have to go through a complete extra step when logging in. Sometimes my phone and extra device are not near me either. My roommate also is now terrified to lose her phone because, unlike myself, she does not have a secondary device like a tablet to download the duo app on. If she loses her phone, then she cannot access anything for class or even her email to keep in communication with her professors and classmates.""I have had no interactions with UITS staff or any services beyond using the software provided by UITS (Canvas, IUWare, IU Secure, etc.) as requested for courses and other interactions with the University.""I have had NO negative interactions with UITS staff at all. I spend a lot of time in the Cook Music Library, and print most of my materials for teaching and class (I'm a [IRD]) there. On several occasions, I've had to grab the attention of the on-duty UITS staff person and they have been responsive, kind, and completed the task of fixing what needed to be fixed promptly (be it telling me I needed to add more money to my print allowance or refilling paper into the printer)."I have had positive experiences with the UITS staff in the computer lab in IMU both this semester and last semester. They explained what steps I needed to take to directly or indirectly solve my problems with UITS technology such as the printing system (via email) malfunctioning."I have had positive interactions in person and via chat with UITS. Overall, one of the best IT services I have ever dealt with.""I have not had any in-person experience with UITS; I am a distance student, though, so the services are key to my successful participation in classes. So far, I've mostly been satisfied."I have relied heavily on UITS staff for help. All my experiences are positive. I am very satisfied."I purchased a new laptop at the beginning of the school year and needed help installing everything. For the most part UITS Support Center was very helpful and kind as I came with all kinds of questions and concerns. However, a few months later my computer was attacked with malware and I didn't know what to do. When I took my laptop in to UITS for help, the person I interacted with was (understandably but it wasn't helpful) upset that I'd let it happen. I felt like shit after that encounter and on some level I realized that I hadn't gone in to get help sooner because I dreaded a reaction like that. The next person I worked with who helped me reinstall my operating system was very kind and supportive."I sent some emails to ask about how to use supercomputers in IU. I got some good answers. Thank you!"I was having issues with my computer switching between IU secure and my home Wi-Fi, and I believe I called someone named [IRD] (maybe?) who was a big help in helping me navigate through the mysterious world of the command prompt. He was patient, wasn't patronizing despite the probably easy fix this was, and made genuine conversation when we had to wait on restarts etc. I just like when people can be authentic and not drone.""I would like a bit more flexibility in scheduling jobs/submitting to Karst, or more queue options that suit different usage cases for shorted jobs that can hit a node faster.""I would like for there to be an option to opt out of the dual-authentication system for some employees, as the process makes signing in to one.iu considerably less accessible when one doesn't have a compatible second device nearby, makes the process last two or three times as long as it needs to, and all for relatively little reward -- there is little information in my one.iu account that requires this level of over-security.""I would love a map of where printers are around campus. I rarely print, but when I need to, I'd like to find the most conveniently located ones via a simple map of where they are, if they're locked up, when the building or lab is open."I do QUALITATIVE research and IU doesn't provide access to software (like QDA) or other software used by qualitative researchers. Enough with quantitative already.If the device is registered for that user then let it pass the duo authentication security. It's frustrating every time you need to log in through duo-authentication. What if someone has to submit a very important assignment and his/her phone is switched off or stolen."Implementing online chat form of help, it's very effective!"Making duo login remember the devices I have already used."In general, I am satisfied with everything provided by UITS. The only things that I think UITS may consider improving are the following: ""1. Increase the speed of the internet in some of the on-campus apartment buildings (e.g. Evermann, Red Bud, BBHN). The current speed is fine but still considerably slower than the ones in Campus View, Tuliptree, and other department buildings. ""2. Increase the capacity of the supercomputers. Now the waiting time on BigRed2 and Karst has increased substantially compared to last year, due to the increased demand for the service. UITS may consider increasing the supply in response to that.""Internet is way too slow for the year 2017. Network computers are also too slow, which can take up to 20 minutes to turn on! This is unacceptable for an institution of this size.""Instructions on the UITS website are not easy to understand. They seem to be written by technology folks who understand what they're writing...instead of looking at it from the lens of a person who is unfamiliar with technology. Setting up email, Duo, Box, etc., has not been as easy as it should have been.""Is there a service I can use to effectively find printers near me? Also, is it possible to connect all printers (including the desk printers) so that I can remotely send a print message?""It is very difficult to reach UITS staff and the waits to speak with one are long. I've had many issues with printing and it seems that each staff person contradicts the other. They don't seem to understand that for distance students who only come to campus occasionally, being able to utilize the technology is vital for success."It seems more often this year that printing has been down in the School of Ed library. It's also frustrating to not automatically connect to IU Secure and having to do that automatically."It seems that software at the Herman B. Wells Library Learning Commons is not uniformly installed. For example, SAS is installed on one computer and then not on the computer right next to it.""IU Secure sometimes seems to be particularly spotty on Apple devices (not sure if this is related to my particular OS...I'm running Yosemite on a Mac and iOS 10.2 on an iPhone), especially when walking between 7th and 10th. Again, this could be an anomaly, but I wanted to make someone aware of this.""IU Ware software availability has been significantly reduced, which prevents students from learning software that may be useful in the learning process."I've always been very appreciative of the good service and services provided by UITS.I've had a great experience with [IRD] from the National Center for Genome Analysis and Support (NCGAS). I had an issue running Breseq on Karst and I needed to run Breseq for a class project that was due in a few days. [IRD] helped troubleshoot with me and gave me expert advice that led to me completing my project on time. She responded to my emails promptly and with such attention to detail. I'm very grateful to her for her help."I've used some of the UITS information online, but I've never contacted UITS by phone or in person. The online supports have been helpful for finding what I needed (printing on campus, iuanywhere, iuware, vpn, etc.)."Logging in every day seems to take a long time (i.e. loading a user profile) and then stepping through one.iu.edu to get where you really want to be. Surprisingly the Duo authorization isn't as painful as I imagined.Logging on to computers in the Wells Library commons often takes a very long time. I'm unlikely to even attempt it at this point. Wireless service is also uneven across campus."Most of my interactions with UITS have been in the form of workshops. I have also sent in two email questions, one about file conversion and one about Box. The latter of these experiences was negative, as the responder simply sent me a link I had already explored.""Most of my UITS-related experiences involve printing. It has been frustrating at times to have to switch printing methods. Up until a year or two ago, I could print directly from Word or Acrobat or whatever program I was using. Then I had to switch to uploading documents online to My Print Center, which often did not work and was completely unavailable for several days a couple of months ago. Now I can print directly from my computer applications again, which I prefer over uploading documents to a website.""I also use campus computers sometimes, especially the ones in the IMU lab. The computers tend to be slow, though, and I only use them for programs I cannot run on my Mac.""Interactions I've had with UITS staff have been very helpful. They have not only helped me solve issues, but they have done so efficiently by quickly providing solutions or links to relevant resources.""The Duo login thing is ridiculous. We already have to use absurdly long ""passphrases"", then we have to confirm on a secondary device every time we log in?! If I log in on my phone, then I'm prompted on the same phone to confirm... it isn't even a secondary device, it is the same device! My bank, which has all of my money, just asks for a six-character password with a combination of letters and numbers, and it has me do a one-time verification when I use a new device to access my account. Why does the University need to verify every time I log in to Canvas?""Mostly all positive experiences, especially with the help personnel. I do wish it was simpler to send to campus printers from my own laptop while on campus, or at least in the library."My experiences with UITS staff are mostly positive. I have no recollection of real negative interaction. "The IU secure in WY, however, refuse to log me in occasionally. This stops me from receiving emails, for example. ""The Duo Verification is a dumb idea for non-financial services. Unless there are substantive evidences for cheating via hacking canvas, I do not understand the incentive to have Duo covering every student and faculty services. I have heard many complaints among my peers. ""The HPCs are invaluable assets in my research. My experience with HPCs are most positive. But it would be even greater if HPC team can update the compilers to gcc6, and perhaps provide a rough estimate for waiting time after one submit a job.""My only complaint is when the printers go down or run out of paper (frequently in the Godfrey Center). Also, I don't like that my computer always makes me select IU Secure and tries to log me onto ATT Wi-Fi first."No negative interactions as such.'Register for classes' web page should be considered for a Re-design to look and feel similar to IGPS.None.Nothing comes to mind."On the graduate side of the Kelley School of Business, we need better printing technology and more frequent maintenance to keep the printers from breaking down on a daily/weekly basis.""One comment for improvement. When I started out as a student, I didn't have a CAS account, and could not access any of the pages in One.IU. All I had was the credentials that I used for applying to be a student. It took me days to realize that I needed to create this account.""Embedding videos in Canvas using Caltura does not serve well. Compared to YouTube, for instance, it loads slower, and sometimes gets stuck while playing. The options, such as video resolution quality, are lesser.""Positive: 24/7 availability, always a an answer to my questions. ""Negative: stripping away software packages from lab computers, drastically and frequently changing the tools / user interface of software (e.g., Adobe PDF); requirement of security key for teachers; slowness of IU AnyWare."Printing credits make no sense to me. Why not just translate 1BW page = 1 credit or 1 color page = 2 credits."Printing: I've had some good experiences, and some bad ones. I know there are technical hurdles to this, but it still seems weird to me that getting something to print at the printer I want can be a challenge. In this regard, I'm mainly referring to mobile print, which I've had trouble with at Wells and at my on-campus office. For instance, using mobile print at Wells, is there an easier way to name the printers (e.g., ""Wells 13"")? This is compared to the complicated and technical naming convention in place (""BL_LI137_MFP1""), which has to be typed in exactly correct."Signing up for classes is painful. Canvas is great."Staff is great, Duo is a hassle and unnecessarily complicated.""The biology technical staff is great. They answer my questions and notice things about my computer that I didn't know and made it better. For UITS in general, sometimes reaching the library through pulse secure doesn't work well from off campus.""The dual login system is unnecessary, cumbersome, and annoying. There have been times when I have been unable to login to my class Canvas page on campus because I accidentally left my cell phone at home, and consequently can't get the activation codes (or whatever they are). Furthermore, the dual login system is extremely unfair to faculty or staff who may not be able to afford multiple digital devices at one time. The university seems to be assuming that everyone can afford to buy or maintain a stable cell phone plan. ""The barrier for initially learning how to navigate the many different IU web portals/pages is way too high. I feel like everything is decentralized, and each site has its own interface and rules. It's absurd that whenever IU sends me an email about doing anything online (e.g., entering in early student attendance reports), that the email contains a list of instructions for how to access the site RATHER THAN a direct URL to the site. Why is everything so cryptic and multi-stepped?"The IT services generally tend to work well only for those who have the most high end and expensive equipment such as Mac laptops. I have a Windows laptop and I couldn't even get them to install the printer on my laptop. This makes life very inconvenient which defeats the whole purpose of IT."The law school printers are often unreliable, especially when using the ""My Print Center"" program. The print system must be updated.""The main problem I usually have deals with loss of internet/Wi-Fi. I have a personal router and get internet through campus, and sometimes it goes out. Every time I've called UITS they are extremely helpful and patient with me - even when they don't end up doing anything and it's an issue on my end!""The optometry library printer breaks at least 2 times a week for the last two semesters. With such a technology advanced campus (especially with the new duo login system to access everything) It is especially difficult and frustrating to have a broken printer and have a release station. Why is it one of the libraries on campus yet the printer is very old school, outdated and cannot handle the work load of the professional students. It would benefit to have a larger, newer printer that you swipe your card in to release documents (like in the Union, and Jordan Hall, and most of the other printers on campus).""The compulink learning environment for the students to practice on continually shuts down and crashes, maybe restarting and deleting the data on the program prior to each semester could help alleviate the issues.""The projector in optometry 105 doesn't project colors properly, and the document camera in opt 105 has shadows on it and needs to be recalibrated to help with students' focus on the projected information.""The printing experience at IU is severely deficient. As a [IRD] year grad student who has experienced the printing experiences at another B1G school, I can make the comparison. IU Mobile Print seems like a second thought, and sometimes does not work. The Mac native printing experience seems nonexistent, which ignores probably a 50/50 split of use between PC/Mac.""The services provided by IU UITS is excellent. I have attended some of their certificate training workshops and have found them to be very helpful. I have also found the campus facilities well up-to-date with the latest technology. The only service that I have been asking IU UITS to purchase and to consider is a scanning kiosk (Knowledge Imaging Center (KIC)) to be placed in the Wells Library for students to scan books. Unfortunately, IU UITS has refused or denied my request several times which I do not agree. Almost 90 percent of major research universities now have a scanning kiosk from Knowledge Imaging Center. Why not IU? - [IRD]""The staff at the walk-up desk in Wells and answering chat messages are usually not experts, and are only able to help with basic issues. This is sometimes helpful, but usually the advice they can give is only what I've been able to find myself already. I've had generally positive interactions otherwise.""I have found Duo sign-in to be cumbersome and largely unnecessary. IU passwords are already long and complicated, and adding a second step just makes it more burdensome to log in. I have lost money (though admittedly not a lot) because it takes me so long to log in to Kuali Time that it appears I have arrived late to work. I am more distracted at work because I have to have my phone at my desk. It seems odd to me that when I log into IU accounts on my phone I have to switch apps in order to log in, and both authentication steps are occurring on the same device.""A minor complaint: the computers in Wells 002A are so large that if you sit anywhere further back than the 3rd computer you cannot see the board, and anywhere you sit it is impossible to see the rest of the class.""The UITS staff are friendly and helpful, however it would be helpful if they had a more visible presence in areas such as the SPEA/Kelley Info Commons; when something goes wrong with the printer there is no one to ask for help. Also, if staff could make sure that paper is always stocked in printers available for student use (outside of Wells Library) that would be greatly appreciated! Maybe even putting a little sign saying ""Have a problem with the printer? Contact UITS at ... and we will help you resolve it"" at printers would be greatly helpful."If GIS and OriginPro could be installed on more computers that would be greatly helpful."Also, I wish I could access my IU e-mail address directly through the ""mail"" app on my smartphone instead of having to go through an internet browser every time. If this is already possible, it would be great if that info was more widely disseminated."There should be more in-person technology teaching sessions available."There are strange dead spots on campus for Wi-Fi. For example, a lot of people seem to struggle with Wi-Fi in the room across from the computer lab in the basement of Wells. People also struggle to get Wi-Fi in the Lilly Library."They are indeed helpful.They have been very attentive and responsive!"To date the staff have been friendly, engaging, and helpful."Train the plotter printer student employees better."UITS is always helpful to me. 24/7 chat help is always available and it's awesome. I also like that there are computers everywhere, except that Windows 10 loads very, very slowly at startup (upon login)."UITS is an incredible service that really stands out among other university technology services I've experienced. Their 24-hour phone number and help desks have gotten me through many technology snafus in the years I've been at IU."It would help me significantly as a student if there was a quicker, easier way to print on campus. Without a printer at home, I rely on IU technology for all my printing. However, the time it takes to find an open computer, go through all my log-ins and authentications, etc., becomes quite an ordeal if I'm ever in a hurry.""Also, some sort of map or location service to find computer labs or workstations on campus (perhaps there is but I don't know about it) would be very helpful. I so often find myself looking for a place to study, and either struggling to locate computer labs in unfamiliar buildings or failing to figure out when they close at night or have classes in them. Some way to streamline this information would help me to access more of IU's technology services.""UITS staff are always friendly and helpful. The Duo authentication thing never works for me -- I'm able to get into my accounts, but it never asks me to do the Duo authentication. Not sure if that's a problem."Very good experiences with drop-in services. Quick fixes to problems. Only complaint is that sometimes printing can be unreliable in certain buildings on campus."Also, canvas is infuriatingly slow. The lag on that website reminds me of dial up internet. I love the site, it's just slow to load."What's the difference between a 3 and a 4?"When trouble arises, whether it is in the classroom, or privately owned devices, my experience both as a teacher and a student have been outstanding. I have, on several occasions, obtained requested assistance immediately and completely. I have nothing negative to say, and I sure do not know enough to suggest anything.""Whenever I have had problems using classroom technology, UITS has been very helpful."I don't like how the forwarding options between Outlook and Umail end up with some messages that are only sent to one service and not the other. I now only use Umail since Outlook wasn't able to handle my Umail forwarding."While this did not happen to me, I knew people who struggled to use the Duo system because they could not get a signal at the location of their workplace on campus. This caused them trouble clocking in and out of work. Also, the Duo system is not well-suited for those without smartphones. These people cannot just push another button to log in, because they don't have the capability to have an app on their phone.""You guys are pretty awesome and do a great job for IU. I just think the DUO login stuff SUCKS! I get that it gives us more security, but it is such a pain, it's just one more barrier to email and canvas. Can we have the option to remove it on some things? That would be helpful.""A couple weeks ago, I had a problem with a desktop computer located in Willkie center building. When I was working on an assignment due at midnight that night, the computer unexpectedly went into sleep mode and would not come out of it. It was 9:00 p.m. and I called UITS for help. They tried telling me a couple of things that I could do, all of which I tried with no success. That was understandable. However, they then told me there was nothing they could do to help me. I was very dissatisfied with the lack of care or information that I was given about how to further solve the problem."Absolutely dislike the two step login."Assistants at the UITS help desk at Wells are generally prompt and prepared. There could be improvement with wait-times and appointment sign-ups to increase efficiency. DUO has some problem-areas - it is recommended that DUO two-step authentication not be applied to all applications requiring IU login (for instance, applications that allow someone to report a stolen or lost ID should be able to bypass DUO authentication, as phones are often stolen at the same time as IDs, which means that individuals can't readily report their cards stolen)."Better Wi-Fi Connections.Warnings to system shut downs.Canvas sucks."Clarifying downloading and using Microsoft Office for Mac, how to report phishing incidents."Computers are slow.Duo is possibly the worst idea anyone has come up with at IU in recent memory. The perfect way to mess up already busy students' lives."Easier ways to get Photoshop on computers, easy directions."Every time I have gone to UITS they usually cannot help me with the problem I have.Every time I try to print something off of my computer the server is not working or the printers wont print/work. When I ask for help over something as simple as printing I get redirected and have to wait because only one or two people can fix the problem. It is frustrating every time I need to print something it takes me at least an hour or more when it should only take a few minutes at most."Everything I have experienced thus far with UITS has been an immense pleasure due to the fact that an answer is always found for my problem, whether that be a direct response or possibly an alternative solution that still answers my problem."Everything is good but the only thing that I want to feedback is the thing that when I try to modify my search I need to re-fill out all blank to search.Extremely difficult to print. Has been an issue since after Winter Break. Takes a half hour to print something. Big issue."Hello,""I've only had a handful of experiences with UITS and they seem fairly pleasant. My only real issue I have is with IU Secure. The connection always seems to drop out or load very slow. Not sure if there is anything to be done, but that would be my only complaint.""I am dissatisfied with the quality of desktops in the SPEA/Business information commons. I use desktops frequently on campus, and these are the worst. They take long to log into. They also have many minor functionality issues that drive me nuts. I use Visio for many of my classes; creating objects and dragging them into the correct place never works... the mouse does not respond like you would expect. ""However, I am very satisfied with many other IT moments I have with IU including: internet speed, IU anyware software offerings, Canvas education management SaaS, other computer labs. Overall, well done!""I am happy with the UITS services. I have spoken with the staff members in the computer lab in the IMU multiple times and they have always been friendly and helpful. However, I find some of the online information difficult to navigate. For example, my club has a web account through IU and I had to get the password reset, and it was difficult to find information about how to do that. I also find the Student Center class registration system very annoying. It's like there are different places to search for courses versus adding them to your cart so you have to try to remember the course number to add it to the shopping cart, but sometimes that doesn't work either. It's also very annoying to have to keep entering the same search info over and over again ""undergraduate :: Bloomington :: spring 2017 :: department"" etc. I wish the search function was more like the other course browser app on one.iu.edu. Also, with the umail accounts, I have trouble accessing other google products, like YouTube. It would be nice if they functioned as full google accounts.""I am thoroughly pleased with the UITS staff here on campus. Unfortunately, I haven't had a lot of contact with them, but last Saturday I went in to get my computer fixed. I was helped immediately and the man attending to my computer was very helpful and knowledgeable. He answered all the questions I had for him, upgraded my operating system for free, and even downloaded all of the essential applications I needed after I got my hard drive wiped. It took about 30 minutes and it was well worth it.""I am very satisfied with the experiences I have had when I have gone to the help center at Wells Library. The people who helped me were very friendly and dedicated to getting my problem resolved. However, I have not been very satisfied with IU Secure because it isn't always reliable. Also, I have been very dissatisfied with the printing system on campus. Nearly every time I print something, uploading it online to the Print Center doesn't work and I need to log in to the campus computers in my dorm which are very slow.""I believe there needs to be some updating with the computers in the West Tower of Wells Library, particularly in the 5th floor. The computers are slow, making it inconvenient to work in that area."I can say that all experiences I've had with UITS staff members have been professional and beneficial. The online chat service is awesome and very convenient."I didn't interact much with UITS employees this year. The few times I did in the library, they were able to help me out."I don't have a lot of experience with UITS staff. I think most of IUs programs run fine for me and I haven't ever had a major problem with them. I did ask how to setup a streaming device in my dorm room and UITS staff was very helpful and I got it setup quick. They took time to look up information and answered me in a timely manner. Sometimes IU secure is down or a little slow but UITS does a good job of getting it running again.I feel like the student center needs a new look. It's format seems kind of outdated and it could definitely use a makeover.I had troubles connecting my devices to the Wi-Fi and they are always helpful getting my certificates. I don't have anything negative to say about UITS."I hate the duo log in process. I've heard nothing but complaints about it from students. It makes checking your email or canvas twice as difficult and takes twice the amount of time. I do not understand, as a student, why I had to change to the duo log in. If I forget my phone or have it in a different room, or its dead, etc. I can't check my grades or even get into my account. This is annoying and more difficult then it needs to be."I have attended a training on CSS & HTML."I have been most successful when talking to UITS staff in person or over the phone. Sometimes working with technology requires restarts and then I lose the UITS chat, plus talking with someone can make fixing my computer less stressful.""IU secure can be unpredictable, especially in older buildings on campus""I have really only visited UITS once or twice, but this year, it was crucial. Essentially, my laptop had downloaded some Windows update incorrectly and would not boot. After 5-6 hours with UITS across 2 days, we were able to get my files off before deleting my hard drive and ultimately reinstalling the OS. My computer works great now, and I haven't had any issues since August. Great job!""I'd very much like to see the redesign/decommissioning of the Student Self Service portal; it's always been difficult to navigate, and now looks old and non-user friendly."I'd also like to see more kinds of software come to IUWare.I haven't used UITS except for getting help on how to use the scanners at the IMU. The guy that helped me was very informative in explaining what I needed to do."I just have one thing to say that is about a printer (it might not be about UITS though). I often use a printer, but it often has problems, so I cannot print out what I need.""I like how the UITS works. Whenever I go to UITS service at the Wells library, I always am satisfied with visiting even though the waiting line is long.""I love IU, the star as well as the students. I'm happy that I decided to further my career here at IU."I love the KB!I hate how IU email accounts are distributed. Having exchange & umail & indiana.edu has been a nightmare for me.DUO authentication rollout should have been more aggressive about giving out the handheld token generators."I personally don't like duo. I appreciate the attempt at adding security to log ins, but it's extremely inconvenient if I'm trying to log on and my phone is dead or trying to clock in at work within a timely manner.""I rarely have issues that I need to report to UITS, but whenever I do run into them, I have positive experiences with UITS. I feel like they do a great job keeping the systems up and the duo process log in is a good move.""I really dislike the duo two step system. I understand that it is to ensure extra safety for our information, but it's really inconvenient. Sometimes, my cellphone dies and I don't have access to canvas after that, or sometimes I might forget my phone at home, and make it all the way to SPEA, which is a 45 minute walk from my house, and not be able to access my email, class information, or any other IU information I might need. Even if there is a two step system, I feel there is a huge need for revision to be able to access IU services without a phone."I rely on them.I think the UITS staff are great at responding to problems.I think the Wi-Fi has been improved and now it's available throughout the campus although sometimes it's either weak or unavailable outdoors. Improve on that will be my first suggestion."I think UITS has a lot of helpful services and the website is full of useful information. There's actually so much information it would be helpful to have a page that briefly outlines UITS's in-person services and online info based on activity (e.g. print from your computer, using box, other services IU offers, improve your knowledge of your PC, etc.).""I think UITS should be more open to students. I noticed that there are a lot of useful applications on one.iu, but there is still room for improvements."I would like stronger Wi-Fi signals across campus. It would be nice to work on my laptop in the arboretum."In general, I find that UITS hierarchy of solving issues takes too long and things occasionally end up more complicated than necessary to solve simple problems. I think UITS sends too many emails about things that are vaguely useful or only useful for a small population. I also have noticed an increase rather than a decrease in the number of phishing emails since duo. Additionally, relating to the retirement of some of the programs, I believe it took far too long and that deadlines were pushed back several times instead of having a hard line when people needed to adopt new technology which caused frustration when taking classes that instructors were allowed to use different technology to post grades and assignments.""In regards to Duo Login, that definitely is quite frustrating. I understand the need for Duo to be used for student financial reasons, and for faculty, but I find it highly unnecessary for students to deal with. Especially in this day and age, things happen to our phones easily. Therefore, that can make it nearly impossible to access our accounts."It is great! They are very welcoming and attentive to new customers.Is there a way to make the adobe connect classes more accessible on other browsers?"It is kind of embarrassing because you have to take many steps, but it is nice that personal privacy improved."IT services have helped me boot camp my computer and help with wireless connection issues I have."IT has not been helpful with me bypassing the 2 step login since I am studying abroad and can't access my IU accounts. IU IT services are not being helpful in connecting me to a supervisor who can help me with my issue and is instead asking me the same questions if I can call in my problem, and as I've explained, I cannot due to not being in the country.""It's absolutely ridiculous that the GetConnected application is required to connect to IU Secure. It's a Wi-Fi network. Use a captive portal or something, but don't make me install some random software to which I then need to give admin access just so I can get on the damn Wi-Fi. It's spyware, and needlessly complex.""I wish there was a web portal for printing - I installed the application for printing from a personal computer a year or two ago, and it worked for a short time, but then failed completely. A web portal where documents could be uploaded (maybe you could integrate it with Box?) and sent to the print queue automatically seems relatively simple to develop, and would free up the computers around the busiest printers (such as in Kelly) where lines form so people can log on, open their file, print it, then log off, because it's such a pain to print directly from a personal computer.""One.IU.edu is a great website - why is Student Center so bad? It's barely usable, ugly, unintuitive, and obfuscated to the point of absurdity. You've gotten rid of OnCourse and OneStart; those were good moves, but why is the worst piece of software with which students interact still here? One.IU implemented a review system - how about you read some of the reviews for Student Center? https://one.iu.edu/task/iu/student-center""I know people don't like Duo, but I commend UITS for mandating MFA - great move.""I think it's been more than a year since this change happened, but the unlimited storage on Box is great. Unfortunately, I don't think many people know about it. Same thing with iGPS - great software (although I wish it still had the ""build schedule"" feature) that nobody knows about.""IU Secure Wi-Fi is very difficult to stay connected to, especially in the Public Health Building. Some instructions on the website are difficult to navigate- still can not figure out how to connect my kindle to IU Secure, for some reason there is a different procedure.""I've been having a lot of trouble with the print services since the beginning of the semester, especially in Jordan Hall and the School of Public Health.""Additionally, it is impossible to get Wi-Fi in some classrooms. This is kind of ridiculous to me. In about 3/4 of Jordan Hall the Wi-Fi is terrible. Simon Hall also has some issues, but not as bad as those in Jordan. It makes it really difficult to do some internet-based assignments in class.""I've had a terrible experience with UITS. Last year I had my school email hacked and every time I would go to get help they wouldn't be able to. However, they would give me a name and number of someone who was supposed to help me. From there that person would refer me back to UITS and it was a 4 month long process where the police had to get involved."I've had only good experiences."I've had very limited interactions with the UITS Staff, but they've all left me with decent impressions. The most useful and positive experience I had was with the online-chatting system. The respondents were fast, kind, and were able to solve all of my problems every time. This is a feature that is still very important to me and should be emphasized to those looking for help but are also busy and may not always be able to come in person to have their problem reviewed. Sometimes there have been hardware problems in lab locations with various computers, but otherwise there aren't too many noticeable problems I experience daily."I've never used the assistance of a UITS staff member.I've only had positive experiences with UITS staff. They were very friendly and able to properly diagnose my technological issue in a timely manner. I wouldn't change a thing."I've used UITS multiple times for computer questions. I've used them at Wells, McNutt, the union, and on the chat and phone features. I've always has positive experiences and they've always been helpful to the extend that they can be."Make an easier way to connect personal laptops to available printers."Mobile printing is one of the most inconvenient services offered. I am a sophomore and I have a lot to print from home but once I come to campus and try to print, it deletes my print order from the documents lists, and I have been in jeopardy several times because of this. Hope you could improve this service."My issue with my login was fixed in a timely manner.N/AN/ANoNo comment.No problems with UITS staff or services."Overall, I am satisfied with our technology services, although there can be issues such as periodical crashing.""Overall, I have had generally positive experiences with UITS and its services. I'd also like to compliment UITS on the ONE IU search function, as I believe it was a really useful way to present everything.""Overall, it is great. I wish the IU secure could be more stable.""Please find a way to make HUE lights work on the network. Also, UITS is notoriously condescending and rude. Information gets through, but people are often not willing to talk to UITS because of the way they respond to people.""PLEASE get rid of Duo. It is awful and a gigantic pain. Plus, it isn't even on my phone so it isn't enhancing security all that much. All it does is infuriate people and make it so that we would get locked out of our systems if we forgot anything. I am a full time student as well as an employee and it is awkward having to use a device to log in to Canvas during class hours.""I am graduating this semester so there isn't really much benefit in contacting me and Duo will no longer be impacting me, but I figured I could add my voice to those of others."Please improve the student center!Printers are often out of ink."Setting up printing from a laptop is slightly tricky, and I would love to see a list of where all campus printers are. Usually UITS is very helpful and refills paper or fixes jams fairly quickly."Some printers in the library or Kelley don't work well.Sometimes IU Secure randomly disconnects even if I remain in the same place."The actual staff are quite nice; however, OneStart is still absolutely awful."The best thing about anything involving technology on this campus is that it just works! I think the IT team is always working hard to be knowledgeable and I have yet to have a question that couldn't be answered by UITS staff."The customer service is really great, keep doing what you're doing there. My one issue, however, is that remote printing is a pain. Apparently, there's an app for my computer I can get but I can't find the information on that on the UITS website and the remote printing website rarely works.""The live chat help is useful and most UITS staff are pretty knowledgeable. But many of the hardware and software programs provided are unreliable, namely those used through the Citrix receiver. Software and hardware issues often go unresolved. 2 of my 3 business classes this semester have had changes in the course due to technological limitations that haven't been fixed, despite being halfway through the semester. Many computers are also slow and outdated in Well's library and Kelley computer labs."The main concern I have is giving incoming students information on how to fix any simple problems themselves. And info about network cords.The mobile print function/website needs to be majorly overhauled. It works incredibly inconsistently when no-hassle printing is a very basic and very necessary need of students.The one area that I feel we fall short is with our print servers. 50%+ of the time documents I print never make it to the print station."The only negative interaction I've had with the technology here has been the computer labs in Eigenmann. Even though they work efficiently, the time for the computers to log into your account takes a good amount of time. Other than that, they have been reliable.""The only thing I could recommend is a better way for students to report service outages. I've worked on IT before, and I know when a printer is no longer connected to the IU print system. I'd like to be able to report that without emailing or calling."The printers in the residence halls never seem to be working and take forever to get fixed."The printing is extremely slow in the SPEA/Kelley area. The computers take forever to log on, and sometimes it doesn't even get sent to the printer.""Also, I tried to get my laptop hooked up to the printing and I was told some laptops would never connect to the network. I wish the service worked with all computers because I have a relatively new HP and was denied."The printing system needs to be fixed ASAP. Mobile.Print has not been working this semester."The recital scheduling program for music students still uses internet explorer or Firefox. It could use an overhaul and an update for a better browser, i.e. Chrome. "-it would be nice to be able to check software availability. i.e. a real time eligibility checker tied to course permissions-list online the student prices of any software that has to be purchased in person-creation of an online catalogue of the full range of UITS products (software and hardware)"-a schedule building program built into the course registration process where you select potential courses, and it generates possible schedules would be really nice."The service is great and they are always there and willing to help.The staff provide such excellent service that their pay should be higher."The Wi-Fi ""IU Secure"" did not work all year!!!!! I'm so angry about that. Also, I made many appointments with UITS - someone had come here, but nobody fixed it."The Wi-Fi is terrible. It never seems to work and is extremely slow. The printers also seem to be broken all the time. Also canvas seems to not work most of the time.The Wi-Fi within the dorms really needs improved. On the weekends and Friday nights the Wi-Fi especially in Forest get so bogged down it is useless.They serve me the best and treat me nicely. Guide me very well for the problems that I had. Never had any negative experience with the service."This year, printing has been an issue for me. Trying to find a computer on campus can sometimes be difficult, so it would be helpful if the IU mobile print website worked better."UITS are very knowledgeable people. In the beginning of the semester I got a virus and they were able to get rid of the virus and tell me about the services IU provides for security software. I think it would be helpful to have UITS people in the residence halls because it would be more efficient for the residents instead of having to go to the IMU or Wells."UITS has been overall helpful, with a few minor things here and there. Nothing major to report.""UITS has provided me a lot of very useful services that I use daily. These include software (especially Adobe programs like Photoshop), Box, Canvas, One.iu, and Umail. These run very well and have positively contributed to my learning."UITS is a very helpful resource IU has to offer.UITS provides excellent support each time I visit them. I would try to get a new printer for the Eigenmann computer lab.Very helpful."When my computer had a virus last year, UITS was able to fix it very quickly and efficiently."Wi-Fi needs to be stronger throughout campus."Your techs are great. They're kind, helpful, and want to get the job done. I've had less luck, however, in a few other areas.""I guess I'm not a fan that I am forced to use two-step login even though I'm not a professor or student employee. I'm just a student guys. My friends don't need their phones to log in to Canvas, but I do.""I guess I'm also not a fan of the fact that computers all across campus often take five minutes or more to log in, causing lines to form of people waiting, hoping to be able to print their documents before class. This backup results in dozens of people either giving up (and thus not printing class slides, etc.) or sticking it out and being forced to go to class late because the computers logged in too slowly.""The computers in Union Street Center take about ten seconds to log in. Why do the ones in the Kelley School of Business (and elsewhere) need five minutes? That means that, realistically, there is only time for two people to use each computer in gaps between classes. That's embarrassingly inefficient.""I guess you could say I'm also not a fan of the wired internet slowdown that took place in my residence hall in summer 2016. These ""Aruba"" boxes you installed over the Ethernet ports reduced wired internet speeds by over 400 mbps. You wasted your time and money on a project to make our internet WORSE here. Residents weren't particularly happy.""Further, it didn't help that the Aruba boxes weren't even installed correctly initially, so I (and others) had to wait for weeks for my Aruba box to be fixed. Well, you did send a friendly tech within days to *confirm* that it was broken. The tech was genuinely nice, and confirmed that UITS had broken the port over the summer (shocking, considering it had worked when I lived in the same room the year before) but he wasn't authorized to fix it for weeks because of a network freeze. Great job, management. Truly inspirational.""Then, as I mentioned, after it was fixed, I was horrified to discover that my internet speeds had taken a nosedive from the past year — but the techs were forced to kindly tell me there was nothing they could do because my mbps wasn't quite a single-digit number. Apparently 10 mbps is good enough for ""academic"" uses, according to UITS policy, so it can't be looked at.""This policy is horrifying, and ignores the struggles of college students. Netflix (which I don't have, personally) and other such services require reasonably high internet speeds, and these are how thousands of students cope with the stresses of exams and relationships, and briefly escape from it all. Every IU organization besides UITS emphasizes the importance of taking breaks and not stressing over day-to-day life, including by using such online services. That UITS management established a policy that directly contradicts this is demeaning and definitely worthy of investigation.""UITS is an embarrassment to Indiana University. You have great techs, but for whatever reason management handcuffs them and prevents them from actually solving problems. Management's decision-making with installing the Aruba boxes was sickening. UITS policies are laughable compared to other tech services."Or at least they would be laughable if they didn't hurt people.-- Help Desk staff are absolutely wonderful-- Online wireless access is very spotty"-- School of Liberal Arts IT Support Staff ([IRD]) are a PRICELESS RESOURCE. They are unbelievably quick in responding to faculty concerns, are absolutely reliable, and manage a torrent of faculty requests with enviable patience. I honestly could not be as good at my job without their availability."Always a good experience.Always good."Always helpful, courteous, and patient.""At the instructor station in the computer lab where I teach it often takes about 10 minutes to log in and up to 20 minutes to access and set up a project in Visual Studio. At the beginning of the semester even though I reported a projector problem several days before the start of classes, it had still not even been investigated by the first day of class. Then it took several days to fix. Was not an easy fix. And there are problems almost daily with response times, printing, and Visual Studio freezing up. Sometimes the consultant can help, but often all he can do is send a trouble ticket."Better coordination between IU and IU Health systems."Communication is not always as good as it should be: changes in Canvas, for example, are not always announced with time to adjust to those changes and typically with good rationale for them (TaskStream come to mind; also the shift from Connect to Zoom)."Difficult to get help promptly.DUO - not needed for Canvas. A lot of bother for marginal improvement in security. Wastes a lot faculty time.BOX - not intuitive. Not easy to use with students. Limitations on uploads.Canvas - tied to BOX?? Limited upload capability. Hard to transfer complicated courses from one semester to the next and Canvas does not transfer many of the functions."I am an Apple user. Occasionally have difficulties with the Exchange, UITS cloud service changes not communicated. I use my own Apple in the classroom - the workstations in various classrooms and IUPUI student center are different, making plug-in a nuisance/problem when moving between rooms.""Need to pay attention to user needs and simplify and train - rather than force changes that are unwelcome (e.g. DUO). Do fewer things very well, rather than have lots of things that don't work well or very challenging to make usable (e.g. video recording in the classroom)."Make the in-class stuff easy to use - always a surprise when I need to occasionally use the windows system and find the programs that I need.We are the customer .... please help us rather than jam changes that require lots of time and effort on our part to implement and/or troubleshoot. Figure-out the total cost (including faculty time) in the changes that you have implemented. I spent countless hours converting to Canvas as well as lots of wasted time using DUO just to log into Canvas and Box ... and I still get all the phishing stuff.Everyone was very professional especially [IRD][IRD]Generally satisfied. "I'm not that happy with Box, however. I also use Dropbox (for free), and find that its implementation across platforms and file types just works better than Box, which often generates error messages during sync. Great to have access to the unlimited cloud space on Box, but I have never been able to get it to work on iOS, whereas Dropbox has been no problem."Helpline staff helpful when I phone in with laptop problems. I'm glad they are available weekends / evenings.Wi-Fi not adequate on campus. Duo is a headache. No walk-in service after hours -- or when the it building is closed. (Made a special trip to pick up a duo device but the building was closed.)Hire better people."I am satisfied with the services received. The knowledge base is a great resource that I always use in case I have any doubt. Besides, UITS has always given be a quick response whenever I have needed their help, either installing a new research or managing software or solving minor issues.""I find that the HELP desk staff are not particularly knowledgeable about some of the course management systems, like Canvas. I usually seek advice from staff at the Center for Teaching and Learning instead."I find them to be incredibly responsive each time I contact them."I have had - in the past, these seemed to be reconciled now - instances in which my needs (including access to necessary software and fixes to my computer) were delayed for months. Because every aspect of IT needs has to go through the IT services, and we are at the mercy of whomever to which we are assigned, small and large adjustments and needs are taken out of our hands. While I appreciate that there are many things I cannot and should not be able to do (I know I am not very tech savvy), basic updating and downloading administrative rights and the ability to circumnavigate assignments that are not working for academic time restraints must be in place. I have excellent experiences with support for Canvas and other in-the-moment 24/7 help items ([IRD] assistance has been excellent!!), but other long-term, time sensitive items such as SAS updates and rebuilding of motherboards and assists with unresponding usb-ports have been very frustrating.""In addition - there is a serious problem with Phishing and other concerning activities. Each time I have tried to utilize help or report an issue, I have been yoked in arduous ways in regards to documentation and otherwise, keeping me from reporting subsequent and future concerns. These processes need to be easy and ""report it/leave it"" for busy researchers and teachers. Having to become a detective to find out the problem in Phishing situations or Canvas problems defeats the purpose of turning to IT professionals.""I have had nothing but very positive interactions with UITS staff. Everyone has been very helpful, especially for non-techy people such as myself.""I rely on classroom technology to teach, and just this semester I have had to go without technology on at least two occasions. I also think faculty should be informed when Canvas is down so that before we enter the classroom, we have time to prepare adequately.""I think it's important to make sure IT services are always user friendly. e.g. I've found the Duo authentication a bit cumbersome at times for services that I use repeatedly - but overall I think it's been a pretty successful roll-out; it would just be nice to NOT have to authenticate, for example, on my personal computer repeatedly.""I wish that it were easier to get copies of MS Office as well as Visio, particularly if you have multiple personal computers. I have not tried Office 365 yet. MS student discounts are not very significant for expensive products like Visio. It should also be easier to get copies of operating systems. In general, IU does a good job providing resources, but these are areas that have become more restrictive over the years. Appreciate the ability to provide feedback. Thank you for everything that you do for us.""If there is any way to change the format of canvas email to a date based email rather than conversation, it would be very helpful. It is extremely difficult to search for emails in the current system."In general I have always found the UITS staff very friendly and helpful.I thought of 2 additional comments during the survey:"1) Saving data and output files in SPSS is very awkward - the default locations are not reachable from anywhere else (and maybe don't permanently store anything), and its very difficult to find a way to your own drives and folders. I have not tried cloud storage to see if it works better. It would be nice if a user could set up a default storage location the first time they use SPSS that activated each time that user accessed SPSS.""I recently used one of the Student terminals in the space between Psychology (LD) and Engineering (SL), and found the setup remarkably uncomfortable. I can't remember the exact problem; I think it was that I had to crane my neck upward to see the monitor. It was almost unusable.""My answer to the question about participating in a focus group is maybe. It would depend on when, how long, and the particular topic.""In my particular field, geography, we use remote sensing and geographic information system software extensively. We are one of the few research-oriented universities I know where having access to multiple software titles is not the norm or falls on departments or schools. Even more concerning, we have been in discussions with UITS personnel (myself and colleagues from IUPUI and IUB who also teach in these fields), and the level of support we have been receiving is on the decline. We had far better support and access when tech fees were retained by the school and these services were not managed centrally by UITS."It is becoming completely impossible to navigate your systems. I spend more time putting in passwords that I spend on teaching or work. You need to rethink your computer security methods."It is terrible having graduate students using Umail and staff using Outlook Exchange. It is extremely inconvenient that the two systems cannot be integrated and transitioning from a graduate student to staff was a major inconvenience in terms of e-mail, as I now have two university accounts with non-overlapping contacts that do not sync easily, as well as two calendars. It is a terrible system that seriously needs improvement."It would be nice to have better support for Mac. There are many Mac users on campus but much of the support seems to be focused on PC."It's clear that UITS is involved in a lot of services I use, and I appreciate that. One recommendation I would make is to enable my phone to be able to block spam calls."IU has very impressive IT infrastructure and support. It is much better than those at any of my prior institutions."IU SON IT has been and continues to be very responsive to my IT issues. My one main issue with UITS was regarding Box/Box Health. The primary owner of the account had left IU, and months after she had left, Administrators of the Account deleted it without informing any of the other active members of that account. It was restored for a few days and then disappeared. Fortunately, when it was available, I backed up all the folders. I had informed the technician, who was helping me at the time, that the account had disappeared (again). The easiest solution to restoring that account was for me to re-upload the files back to Box/Box Health."UITS is great and we are generally happy with their work. A few comments about areas of improvement: Kuali is an old system that should be decommissioned. Teleconferencing at IU is difficult. Wireless Internet works poorly. Working with Karst has been difficult: we decided to run our own cluster.I've had really good experiences with UITS for the few times I've had to use them.I've had some issues with having to wait in the evening for help that never appeared (a UITS supervisor learned of this and helped out the next day)."I've only had superb experiences with UITS, especially [IRD] who is an incredible person and asset to Herron School of Art and Design. I would like to see short UITS workshops offered to students at the beginning of every year. I had [IRD] give a talk to my senior class about general information and it was really helpful and improved the semester.""I've used UITS several times the past year. Twice the support person to whom I spoke on the phone was unable to help me with the issue and had to send the problem to someone on another level. Though I received a response from the next level, the response didn't resolve my issue either. I think there are some issues, particularly with Canvas, that haven't been resolved yet, and I am unaware of the conduit though which I would channel those issues. The phishing emails I receive, and there are several, look so real, they are hard to distinguish from legitimate emails; It might be helpful if those emails could somehow be made to look different. Having a repository of scams would only help if the scam had already been discovered. After the phishing email is open, it is too late."Keep up the good work! You all provide so many excellent services for IU IT needs. Small Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS) are going to start playing a prominent role in University research. We need to look forward and consider how to archive these geospatial assets."Methods must be identified and implemented to improve cellphone coverage in buildings where extensive teaching, advising and faculty interactions take place. The Van Nuys Medical Science Building is a prime example. The current home for Medical Student Education within IU School of Medicine as well as the Health Professions Program and IUSM Graduate School offices, is plagued by poor service from most carriers. This makes attending a meeting in this facility a hardship for the students, staff, and faculty (many of whom are volunteer faculty) who are unable to send or receive phone calls or messaging of clinical relevance during their time in the building. Solutions must be found ASAP."My interactions with UITS have all been positive."My office is located in the [IRD] of Taylor Hall and I have terrible cell phone reception. Also, the lower level of IT has bad reception. It would be very helpful if you could improve this."nano"No negative experiences. They've been helpful. Changing the phones so that the are not connected to the computer would be helpful, especially when calling in computer problems."noneOn-site person to help saved time and stress"Overall UITS is responsive to faculty needs, but I am very disappointed with the constant change in software support which seems to pervade the UITS culture. Over the past 2 years, we have routinely been in a rolling model of software implementation/retirement which makes managing our work more challenging than need be. In particular, I am very frustrated with the constant poorly announced CAITS changes to infrastructure, only to find out that this results in a breakage of dependent processes which are business critical to our radiology department. As one of the major PIs responsible for having to handle these poorly managed roll-out schemes, I wish they would perform testing on a development environment and then roll this out to production once they are sure this is viable. All too often new software infrastructure is rolled out and little to no forethought has been placed on how this will impact the faculty or staff members.""Overall, UITS' support services and support resources have been very valuable, useful and helpful in facilitating my work at IUPUI."Please make sure that Linux VPN access/clients are better supported and documented. I am not sure how to use Duo for my non-gui client (instead I do it through Windows and VM but that can be clunky and has other issues)."Positive, positive and positive! Your staff are lifesavers especially when they help us find a lost document at midnight! So true! I have always found your staff incredibly helpful for all of my questions.""I am in a unique situation in that I [IRD] on the IPFW campus, which is Purdue governed. Our systems do not communicate with one another well. I have problems at the IPFW campus that our generally outside the scope of UITS to help with. When they can help, they do. With more politics going on at IPFW, i.e., the split between IU and Purdue, I am actually hoping that things will improve and that we won't have to go through any of IPFW's (to become just Purdue) systems in the future. That would be great! They still use Blackboard for example, for their courses. Everything I do, I am essentially doing remotely from the IPFW campus, and that makes certain things challenging.""In general, I use UITS for support with software and I find them to be consistently amazingly helpful! Thanks for the great work that you do!""Support staff is always efficient, helpful and professional - I am very happy with them. ""The changes made recently regarding the outside log-in to IU and IU Health VPN networks are highly disruptive and render the log-in process almost impossible to use. To access patient information from home, I have to go through two-step log in to access IU VPN network followed by two-step log-in to access IU Health website, followed by log-in to Cerner. This is excessive and takes 5-10 minutes before the information can be accessed. ""Multiple software platforms are not interconnected and use multiple passwords/log-in processes. Synapse (radiology cloud services) does not work on most computers. To sign off on resident dictations, one has to log into an ancient 3M system that uses a different log-in process, forces Windows XP (!) window and fails to work on most computers.""Syncing iPhones has been an issue for me. I am overseas so I will contact UITS when I return. (My phone still shows emails that I deleted from my laptop in my inbox, etc.)"The internet service is down or inaccessible at times which is very inconvenient especially when time-sensitive work needs to be completed.The IT people I interacted with were very responsive and follow me until the ticket was closed.The survey is too long. You need to find a way to tailor questions for specific individuals. For instance questions about IT and research may not be relevant to a staff."The Wi-Fi in the Medical Science Building in Indianapolis is poor. Often it takes 5 minutes or more to connect to Wi-Fi on my phone while in my office, which delays my ability to complete the Duo link. While this may not seem like much of a wait time, it can be very frustrating as one is preparing information for classes on canvas or committees.""VOIP using Lync does not work, at all, in my office. Incoming calls never ring through and always end up in voicemail. Outgoing calls take a significant amount of time to get a dial tone, if I get one at all. There is no cell signal in my office, and so if I need to make an outgoing call I always go to my lab and use its phone."The Wi-Fi service provided by IUSecure is not very fast. Hope you can speed up the service."UITS provides quick service in my research lab, even for my MacBook. I'm very satisfied."The SIS system for HR and students is not as user friendly as most systems at IU. I think this system should be improved.UITS staff are fine.... Cerner is a poor system!You need to create surveys that are shorter as we don't have time for this!UITS staff generally very service oriented and high performing.UITS strategy sometimes veers into pursuing a technology agenda that veers from mission. There can be alignment that allows both technology and mission to excel.Updating the computers. etc. without letting instructors know is not a good idea; nor is the fact that [IRD] is frequently non-operational due to events the night before.UTIS service is reasonably prompt and is effective."We have had issues because we are off campus and used a microwave, which went down, and have had to work off a provider, which has meant slow speeds and inability to perform some work.""When there are shared resources between IU and IU Health, such as printers, it is not always clear how to solve problems that may be network related.""Work with Microsoft Office 365, do more with SharePoint and OneDrive.""* More webinars or streaming for all areas across the university although specifically HR, financial, travel, etc. The university has the tech infrastructure in place, we need more central units willing to utilize the service and adopt the desktop to desktop meetings or training sessions via Zoom and/or Bridge. UITS can help by leading the way and helping other units understand how easy it can be to use the services.""* The university needs a better contact list system. Able to search by name or tags such as school, function, department. Tie it into the annual contact/security updates that occurs via IUOne. "* KB needs and university webpages need better search engine.All good experiences. Nice job.All my issues have been resolved completely and in an efficient amount of time."Always a positive experience on the IU East Campus. [IRD] and the staff have excellent customer service skills. Cheerful, helpful and I would be lost without them."Always a positive experience. We usually work with [IRD] or [IRD] and they are very responsive and terrific to work with.Always helpful.Always very helpful."At this time, I do not have any comments, but I do like being kept updated about important improvements taking place with Technology Services."Before the fall 2016 we were offering technical support to our students in-house for the online Kelley Physician MBA program. We also published contact information for the UITS Support Center. I am the only technical staff in our department and it was becoming difficult to manage resources to support our 80 students. As of Fall 2016 we transitioned to recommending UITS (including a link to the KB) as the first point of contact for technical support and removed my contact information from our student resource list. The experience has been very positive for our students and it has freed up my time to focus on other technical aspects of the program. The Support Center is an especially valuable resource for our students who rely heavily on technology to complete their degree."Being forced to use my personal smartphone to use the two step log in is inappropriate, especially when sometimes the internet connection is not good and I have to use data to get on my phone. I use this to log into Kuali Coeus IRB and to use the VPN. Hard to access if I have forgotten my phone in the car or at home!!!! Why are we using our personal devices as required items for work?""Better integration/communication of IU Health IT and IU IT services. As a [IRD] located at University Hospital, I must use many services provided by IU Health (Cerner, Provation, fax/scanner services, etc.) which interconnects with my IU computer. When those systems fail, it is extremely difficult to get problem resolved because both IT departments don't communicate efficiently and holding one department responsible to correct is a challenge. Our IU IT staff does their best to help but many times meets resistance from IU Health IT."Every interaction has been positive."Every time I interact with the techs from the help desk, my needs are met. They are not only competent, but friendly and pleasant."Every time I try to connect my Outlook account on a new personal Windows device I have issues even though I follow the same steps and processes. The UITS support staff have always been helpful and thoughtful and have helped resolve my issues in a fairly timely manner. My one complaint/improvement would be to make new software on IUware easier to find. This is specifically regarding the Microsoft Office 2016 rollout. I had wanted to use the updated software and thought that IUPUI didn't have access as the primary link advertised was locked specifically to IPFW. There was another entry however for all other campuses that was inconveniently tucked away. One of the UITS techs had to show me which I was thankful for but frustrated that I could have had the updated software months before I did."Everyone I have encountered is very personable and customer oriented. The online references are not as friendly. Specifically, the DUO sign in for VPN users was very vague and hard to understand.""Generally, I find the UITS staff and services to be easily available and helpful. I occasionally visit the UITS help desk in the IT building and have found the people who work there to be responsive. One opportunity for improvement is for that desk to be staffed by two people more frequently. Sometimes the wait is long - more than 15 minutes. Another option is to call for back up help when more than one person is waiting for service."Hello. I've had very satisfying experiences with our IT dept. The dept. always responds to our needs whether it be hardware or issues with software concerns. They are considerate and don't make me feel foolish when I ask what may seem to them 'simple' questions. I believe they are stretched thin and would like to see additional people added to our building (Dental).Thank you for the opportunity to participate in this survey."Hi, I don't believe I have used UITS services. We have our own IT division in the Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences.""I am less familiar with the IUPUI UITS team more broadly, and have more experiences with the two person team in my department. I find their support to be substantively lacking...in professionalism, expertise, support and progressive theory for IT support. For example, every time we have an issue (which is often), they seem irritated to have to address it and often note that it's really not their domain, but a UITS domain (which I don't really understand). So, some shirking of responsibility. Also, it seems that the team is often encouraging us to use technologies that lighten their support load versus the technologies that actually fit our needs - downward management. Not satisfied at all with the pervasive and consistent issues we have with technology, and the lack of effective, collegial support we receive from the team here in our department."I am relatively satisfied with the services from UITS. HelpNet has been a godsend to this office. I can't thank them enough.I work with the ATAC in Bloomington. They have been awesome as well but need to take the much needed time off. It is ridiculous that people are working there 12 plus hours a day/7 days a week. We can do only what we can do.I would like to see more interaction with the UITS staff. I would like to be invited to the technology conference in Bloomington as it would only heighten my knowledge of what is available here at IU."I don't ever really deal with UITS...I did to set up my phone, but that was all. For work, I have to call CNC, and well that is always a problem as no one there knows anything about MACS and they openly admit that. Why let people in your department get machines to do their work on and then not know how to help them fix issues they have. AGGRAVATING!""I don't have many interactions with UITS, which I think speaks well of the general reliability of their systems.""I don't know if there is an overlap with CAITS vs UITS. I know I have to contact both for different issues. I will do my best to focus just on UITS, but please know that CAITS' reputation has a large impact on my opinions of IT in general.....and I don't feel like we have great service from CAITS. Some is good, but most of the time it is pretty frustrating."I don't use UITS services enough to be have suggestions.I have always had timely responses from IT services."I have been highly pleased with all of my interactions with UITS staff that has assisted me to set up specialized computer classes. [IRD] was very patient and flexible with us and worked hard to accommodate all of our needs, which was no easy task."I have experienced good turn around time for IT problems.I have had only positive experience with UITS."I have had very good experiences with IT staff. Always friendly and willing to work with me. One complaint-when multiple staff members are getting new equipment, please give everyone the same permissions and printers."I have not had any negative experiences with UITS. I particularly like all of the resource software available on IUware and instructional pages (Knowledge Base) for any technology troubleshooting."I have used UITS on several occasions and have been completely pleased. I called about an issue with my W-2 and spoke to a tremendously helpful young man who fielded my question professionally and reached out quickly to his supervisor to confirm one of the issues we discussed. So in terms of both tone and quality of service, I have been impressed. I've had other similar experiences."I have worked a lot with [IRD] and she has been great."I honestly deal mostly with our department IT (MMGE) who are able to solve my problems incredibly quickly, so I do not have much experience working with UITS. It has been fine every time I have, though!""I love that we have an UITS Help Desk in the IUPUI Campus Center. Great location, very convenient.""I rarely interact with UITS staff, maybe a handful of times since I started almost 5 years ago. I primarily interact with my IT person in the department.""Like most of the comments on one.iu, the Duo two step process is difficult and has been frustrating for co-workers since their workstations are not IU computers, but affiliate computers. They are currently unable to log in at their desk and must come to an IU station since the affiliate is unwilling to make changes to the computer. This wastes time and energy. Duo should have been tested on multiple browsers and versions. "I would also urge IU to consider expanding Google at IU to make it PHI compliant (as well as other applications). It is frustrating that most applications are not PHI compliant so research teams are left using REDCap or a Health Box. "Additionally, while a small item, it would be nice if you could numerically organize folders in Box without having to rename them. Right now, you must use 01, 02 if you don't want 21 to jump in front of 3, 4, 5 etc."I really do not have anything to add at this time.I really miss LYNDA...(https://www.lynda.com/)...Do you think we'll ever renew the subscription?I think a central location to identify possible phishing attempts would be a great idea."I think that the commitment to good service can be uneven at times as it concerns faculty facing staff. I have worked with individuals who strive to address issues, working hard to find answers to any solution. I've worked with others who decide that if they cannot immediately address a problem they drop the issue with faculty. "I wish we had more staff who were already or who were encouraged to be more curious and dedicated to finding solutions to problems or exploring what other units do so that they would know that the answer lies within UITS as it so often already does.I think these surveys are only intended to permit UITS to develop rebuttals because I have never seen an end user request implemented."I went to the UITS help desk to get help with setting some things up on a iPad my department gave me to use, and person there said they didn't help with those kinds of issues, only if a computer wasn't working, etc. After going to CTL, I went back to the UITS help desk and this time they person was a lot more helpful."I wish I had known the Research Technologies existed. "The Knowledge Base is incredibly extensive (and helpful if willing to put in the time); unfortunately, each step describing the solution to your problem has a link to another knowledge base page that has a link to another page and so on... In my opinion, there is a massive gap of information in what UITS expects of it's users and what is actually implemented by them - especially in regards to computer security and database systems/management.""I work at the [IRD]. We constantly have issues with our computers and software. Our IT department does the best they can to help resolve the issues, but I feel the biggest problem is the wireless network. Also, computers that are hard wire sometimes will run slow or just freeze at terrible times. Another issue that I've personally witness is when my doctors and I out at Riley Hospital, their laptops don't always connect Axium, which contains important info and radiographs that they need access to, to be able to provide quality care to our patients.""I work for an IU function that is not on an IU campus and only has access to UITS services via phone or remote access. While we are required to use IU systems, the ability to access and utilize those systems is severely hampered by our location. Frequently, it is difficult to make the UITS responder understand our situation. While there have been efforts to improve this, we are still frequently hampered in our ability to function effectively.""I work in [IRD] at IUPUI. I am never sure when UITS needs to get involved when installing camera(s) and/or the best way to contact them. They tend to be an after-thought and either myself or the end-user has to scurry to find a way to reach out to them. We need to have direct access to someone at UITS to handle these types of ""data jack"" issues.""I would like to see a bit more clarity as new systems are introduced and old systems are phased out. For example, when I search for ""video conference"" in the KB, I do not see anything about Zoom on the first page. I think UITS could perhaps use more internal advertising to IU employees of different services along with their best practices and limitations.""I would like to see improved functionality for the Polycom system. Often the participants on the other end are blurry and there is a delay in sound. My office does several cross-campus polycom meetings every week, and our collaboration and communication are not at all on par as if we were in the same room. This is almost exclusively due to the quality of the polycom.""I would really like more of the trainings to be recorded and available for watch on my own time. I have looked for training on Excel and Outlook regularly, and I have not been able to watch recorded sessions once.""I would really like to have classes offered more frequently online regarding Microsoft Word, Excel.""Internet Explorer seems to shut down on me all the time. ""Some websites do not interface well with IE"" is what I have been told. I am unclear about whether or not I can download new browsers.""It would be extremely helpful to redesign the KFS portal. I don't like One.iu.edu overall, but the KFS app in particular is VERY inefficient. I'm speaking about the IU Enterprise Business Systems. Having to navigate through all the KFS options in a single list is a nightmare and it would be extremely helpful to be able to customize all the KFS options in a way similar to Onestart.iu.edu. We need the ability to view the options (and sub tasks) we need and hide the options (and subtasks) we don't. For example, ""budget"". Theoretically, we only use ""budget"" for several months a year, but we have to visually scroll through the list and see ""budget"" on a daily if not HOURLY basis. If we could hide the task until we need it, it would be wonderful! Not get rid of it, but have a hide and unhide option. From a finance person perspective, we pretty much despise the long list and sub tasks. We are in and out of so many of the tasks just to find the information we need for reporting etc., it really takes a lot of our time because we have to find the main task and then the sub task we need. It's difficult to quickly navigate because you have to keep going back to the main list!"It would be nice if Google would not go and come constantly and the internet sites failing all the time."It would be nice if the Symantec security software on the website specified it was also anti-virus. The description is not very clear that it is an anti-virus software and not just some other type of security software. ""Security"" can have multiple meanings. Also, it would be nice to have another ""bookmark"" app within One in which a person can save all of their bookmarks if they wish rather than saving them in the internet browser. Onestart had such an option and it was so handy to save important work related websites that I could access from anywhere in case I did not have my work laptop.""IU is a big organization and is hard to satisfy everyone needs, normally UITS responds very quickly to the clients."I've had excellent resolution of questions I've asked UITS about."I've only had positive interactions with the UITS staff. Services sometimes take multiple follow-ups for response. I really would like for the software developers of programs like KFS (or whatever it's called these days) & TEM to talk to the end users while the software is still in the development stage...so many things about these programs are NOT intuitive, making them more time-consuming than should be necessary. Also, it would be good for the developers to realize that most of the end users are not working in just that one program all day & switching mental gears can sometimes be difficult in a hurry. It would be GREAT if our various systems would communicate with each other.""I've taken one-on-one classes with UITS and they have always been very patient and helpful. It's easier to learn a new program for me when the class is ""hands on."""Just got back to the campus after a [IRD] year assignment with [IRD]. I was issued a new laptop and [IRD] was assigned to get my new computer up and running. He has been nothing but professional in his duties as he downloaded and upgraded the necessary software and doing various troubleshooting to make sure things were working like they should."Lynx is hard and confusing. difficult to make a simple call. Duo is cumbersome. Outlook crashes too much. I am hating VOIP phones....if your computer is down, there is no recourse in an emergency."My biggest concern right now is dead spots in your cell signal inside the buildings as well as the dead space and flakey Wi-Fi from weak signal areas or who knows what. "Please don't assume Wi-Fi is just students checking their Facebook messages, I need a solid and consistent connection so that I can be alerted to updates with my family (namely changes to our two worker household, or emergencies with our children in daycare).""Wi-Fi should be strong, stable and reliable first and foremost in even the most obscure areas of the buildings. Mobile should come at a close second.""My biggest concern with the UITS help line (317-274-help) is that I often encounter a staff member who is unable to answer a technical question or provides incorrect information. One example is when I called the help line last summer shortly after the university started issuing student ID numbers that started with the number ""2"" to ask for guidance on how to enter a series of ID numbers that start with both 0 and 2 into an Excel spreadsheet without losing the zeros. The staff member did not know that answer and didn't make any attempt to figure it out. I was very surprised by this, as I figured I was not the only person in the IU system who would run into trouble with spreadsheets and other documents that contain ID numbers once the new ID's that started with the number 2 were introduced. My coworker ended up finding the answer online. Another example is when I contacted UITS regarding an advisee who was newly admitted and was being blocked from creating a user account whenever he accessed the itaccounts web site. The staff member I talked to consulted with a supervisor and told me we had to speak with an admissions rep at IUB even though the student was admitted to IUPUI. I didn't think this was correct but followed the advice and confirmed that the information was incorrect. The staff member also told me that there was nothing UITS could do to fix the problem even though it was a technical issue. I ended up finding someone higher up the information technology food chain who was able to assist. My suggestion is to provide more training to front line staff and encourage them to try to troubleshoot or consult another staff member rather than simply saying there's nothing they can do to help.""My concern is the confusion relating to what UITS covers and what CNC is responsible for. I upgraded my teacher's station with hardware & software several months ago. The touch screen instructs you to call UITS for help, but when you call the telephone number listed on the screen, the responder sounds confused about whether the problem should be handled by UITS or CNC. ""When there is a problem, the average user does not know if it is a software or hardware problem, or user error. Avoid some of the confusion by listing both/all telephone numbers, and then give the user a choice based on the type of problem. For example; if it's software dial this number, or if it's hardware dial this number, or if it's after hours, dial this number.""My connection to UITS is minimal, but overall satisfactory. I do work with [IRD] and [IRD] and they are both always helpful. UITS did just loan projector bulbs from their inventory to Kelley School of Business which solved an urgent issue for us - greatly appreciated the support!""My experience with installation crews, managers and others has always been very good. My biggest frustration the past year has been with Outlook and all the issues that have probably been reported by hundreds others; but it still seems to disconnect after a time of inactivity and takes a minute to reconnect and upload any new emails and such. I'm also not a fan of DUO being applied to every CAS application as it does slow down your access to information (especially if you are already in a hurry). My only recommendation would be to find ways to maintain security without having so many logins and extra authentications.""My only concern are the updates that have been coming in the middle of the day around Noon. It is very difficult to stop doing work on emails, projects and tasks for a shut down in the middle of the work day, especially around lunch. I have come back to my desk to find my computer has completely rebooted and as a result have lost important emails or files."IU Secure is also very spotty and unreliable for a University of our size."My only thought and concern is that of a very frustrated end user. I work as an [IRD] employee in the department of [IRD]. I am physically located in an IUH facility and have had months of issues getting connectivity issues and the IUH IT and IU PEDS IT teams don't seem to work compatibly together. As an end user....I just want my stuff fixed and when it becomes a political mess amongst the IT departments, it just creates frustration and angst for the end user. I simply wanted to be able to access my server document without having to VPN and use a wireless connection in order to do my job effectively and efficiently. VPN and wireless is not reliable nor fast enough to do my job here....I may as well be working from home where I get better connectivity. While I do finally seem to have resolution.....it took approx. 2 months to get it resolved. Not acceptable""My professor was using Adobe Connect to record lectures in Fall 2016. It was not compatible with Macs. I emailed, and was basically told I was out of luck. No one offered other suggestions for me. ""I have an iupui.edu email. This caused problems with some of the IUware that I wanted to download. It would not accept that address. I had to email back and forth 3-4 times before someone told me I actually had an iu.edu address. The answers were short, short sentences. If the person had taken time to explain this the first time, it would have cut down on confusion and frustration. I still not get a satisfactory answer on how to log on using this other address. I was not at all happy with this lack of concern/explanation. My impression was the person answering did not care or was just lazy."NANANo additional comments."Our department is in the middle of being absorbed by UITS and while I realize there are other factors in play the experience so far has not been positive. There have been very few decisions made as far as how the units will merge and what decisions have been made we have had no input on. Our department as it stands is very small and there is no reason that there can't be communication involving every employee instead of drastic decisions handed down that completely disrupt our work with no one held accountable or reachable. When these decisions are directly tied to technology services within the university it is especially disruptive to the customers we see daily and can't help. From what I've seen, person to person customer service is severely lacking, often to the point where I can't find someone able to help with an issue. I frequently have to provide customers with an email address to assist them, rather than actually being able to help with their problem, which is absurd.""Overall I am pleased with my interaction with UITS staff members and the services they provide. They have been responsive to the issues that I have had in the past and have been quick to resolve them. I would like to see an increase in the trainings (either in person or web-based) that are offered on the various software packages available to university faculty and staff. I am new to using EndNote and would be very interested in learning more about how to effectively and efficiently use it. I have spent a great deal of time fumbling through and trying to find relevant video tutorials on the EndNote site and other training sites. Another would be how OneNote can be used for organization of research and projects--two things that greatly overlap in my job. Or is there another software available to IU employees that is of better use for collaboration and organization of files? My job tasks/responsibilities involve projects that occur on a yearly basis as well as long-term and on-going research projects either on my own or in groups with colleagues both on-campus (IUPUI/IU system) and off-campus. Another would be how to better/more effectively use IU box or Google Drive or other cloud storage/collaboration software. Also, at my previous institution the Qualtric software was available to all employees, but to my understanding, this is only available to specific departments at IUPUI, is this true or a ""campus urban myth??"" On another note, THANK YOU for the switch over to the Zoom platform! This is a great improvement and has made collaborating with colleagues across campus (IUPUI/IU system) and off-campus much easier. I feel it is also important to note that I have only been employed by IU since [IRD] so all of my feedback is looking back to this date.""Overall, the UITS staff has been very helpful and attentive to resolving my issues.""Phones are horrid running on digital. I constantly have dropped calls, calls that ring 1 time and go straight to VM, and I'm sitting right next to my phone working. My boss thinks I'm never at my desk. "Many times it takes 30-60 seconds to get a ring tone to dial out or complete the call. Often I have trouble just making a call out.PLEASE get more consistent WIFI access throughout campus!! PLEASE! In particular in Walther Hall and surrounding areas."Positives are worked relatively quickly on getting me a new laptop and also allowed me to borrow a loaner so that I could continue my work. Negatives are that previously when I was acquiring a new printer it was an extremely long drawn out process. We ended up not even getting our printer until two months after it had been delivered to IUPUI. The only reason I knew it took that they had it that long was because I asked about the warranty. The other item that bothers me is that when I received my new laptop I received it with Office 2013 on it. However, any IT training is only available for 2016. When I received my new laptop in Fall of 2016 why did they not go ahead and load it with 2016? If you are no longer going to have training available for 2013 then you need to start upgrading computers to 2016."Ques 1 positive experiences: can't think of any (ever)"Ques 2 negative interaction: Communication is obtuse, esoteric and full of jargon - I can do the same to UITS in my field; also the ability to promulgate rules (seemingly) arbitrarily or without regard to impact on Customers operations is unhelpful.""Ques 3: improvements - give Customer some ability to address its own issues rather than completely dependent on UITS - UITS response times are slow, with little feedback and little positive resolution""Responses related to campus UITS was specific to IUPUI FIAD Tech Services that oversees FIAD departmental needs. Service is not timely and below par in regards to expertise and support provided. Their internal help desk system is not efficient, have had numerous tickets that take too long to be responded to and resolved. Webpage services are managed by having to request updates through this help desk system which is not timely or efficient.""The IT people are usually very helpful. I knew the Duo log on system was going to be implemented. However, I felt unprepared for the actual start up. I didn't feel I understood how to actually do the duo log on and that it wasn't very well explained. The email screenshots were hard to read. Just a couple of sentences to explain how to use Duo-log on would have been very helpful for me.""The IT people with whom I work most are [IRD] and [IRD]; who consistently go above and beyond, fixing anything we ask them to fix; helping with downloads, laptops, etc. They always come to us and complete work in such a timely manner that I feel like we are the only people in General Surgery with whom they work. But I know that is true for everyone. They are stellar!!!"The gentleman I worked with at the walk-in Help desk and those that I have spoken with on the phone have always been extremely helpful and courteous; as well as efficient and knowledgeable. Thank you all!"The Lync phone system is horrible. I often have to call vendors and they complain that I sound like I am in a tunnel. I've reported this to UITS but am told it's a common occurrence. I feel like most of my interactions with UITS are not resolved (by the person I am speaking to), leaving me feeling very frustrated."The Lync Skype telephone system needs to provide training for support staff because most don't know how to use the phone. They also are not able to transfer calls to voicemail which is very annoying when you have a meeting in your office and you have to let the phone ring so it can go to voicemail."The people I work with at UITS know how I feel about them and the services they provide. We've had many discussions. No need to recount everything here, especially when my comments are about to be posted on a public website."The person at the campus center was very helpful and patient explaining the DUO system."The School of Medicine has a LOT of issues with CIATS (which is now part of UITS). There is lack of transparency, lack of communication, lack of forethought- the entire experience is horrible and needs to be addressed."The transition from Travel@IU to the travel system within KFS has been very rough. There have been a lot of glitches along the way and a lot of delays."The UITS staff that perform the work within our building are always friendly, and efficient. I'm not sure if you have changed your process or not but I have noticed an improvement in communication when attempting to get work scheduled. This used to be a complaint of mine but it has improved greatly."There is limited use of UITS for the department in which I am employed. Our department has IT Specialist on staff.There should be a better way than using DUO for time cards."This past October, [IRD] was instrumental in resolve my issues with Qualtrics. He patiently worked with the vendor to fix the problem on their end. He made my work easier.""This year I communicated my needs for a UITS controlled computer classroom for special needs and those needs were met. I also had a help desk call concerning Canvas and those questions were answered as well. So, so far, everything has been good.""UITS has always been a great partner to Campus Facility Services. Those with whom I have worked directly are: [IRD] just to name a few. They are all helpful, informative, hard working and team players.""UITS is obviously understaffed. I do not blame the staff. But why are resources not being allocated to the very backbone of this university? We can appoint more Vice Chancellors but not allocate resources to support the functioning of basic services? Even requests for very small fixes that could save hours of human resource time each week are ignored. I don't really feel there is a UITS that offers service: Look at the list of tech requests, and how old are those requests?""The university is pouring money and resources through a black hole. I don't spend my time being creative. I spend my time, as do my staff, with dealing with silly/simple system errors that are repetitive. There is no leadership, no one at the helm to drive strategy for UITS initiatives.""UITS needs an internal service that helps UITS staff with security issues. UISO has been unresponsive and generally not helpful several times. Perhaps it isn't their job (to help with lay and complicated security/policy issues) which is fine, but where to go for advice? It would behoove UITS to offer a security consulting service related to advanced technical and policy security issues as well as professional staff to guide the implementation of security issues (especially those which do not yet have a clear policy)."UITS Staff are always timely in their responses and focused on finding solutions which is very much appreciated. I think the best area of opportunity is to make information easier to find regarding enterprise systems that may be beneficial for day-to-day department operations. There are so many systems available at IU it is difficult to find what systems are already here and difficult to figure out the capabilities of those systems that IU already has available.UITS staff are always very professional and approachable. I always appreciate the same day assistance with technology."Very responsive, positive experience, but I don't use UITS much. Don't care for Duo.""We deal mostly with CAITS, however UITS has been very responsive and positive to our needs. Especially when the tokens were introduced. It was very convenient to go to the campus center to have UITS's help. They set everything up for me, I appreciate it very much.""When contacting UITS, it's a 50-50 chance of assistance--sometimes helpful, sometimes not. It can take multiple days, if not weeks, to achieve resolution.""When I have a problem, the IT guys are always quick to respond.""Whenever I put in a work request, they always get back with me in a timely manner. The wireless internet service is a bit slow. I guess due to the construction, the service is either slow or not connecting at all.""While the knowledge base is a very helpful tool, it's written from a very 'techy' lens. Our office is constantly asked to help interpret what to do to fix things or to use products, etc. The help desk chat function is AWESOME. Would like to have many more online/recorded trainings offered so that they can be accessible at our convenience on topics like: SIS Basics, Admin Center (so that we can offer to a new staff member during their first week); IUIE trainings. Would like to have a way to sign up for 'alerts' when job aids are updated. (ittraining.iu.edu/sis in particular!)""While the UITS 4-HELP staff cannot always solve a problem or answer a question, they are highly trained, courteous and know to whom to transfer a high level issue they cannot solve. ""Since the mandate of using the UITS machine room, UITS needs to have test environments for classroom equipment and IUAnyware in both Indianapolis and Bloomington. I have run into firewall issues multiple times when getting software with licenses installed on classroom computers and IUAnyware. This delayed the implementation. Also, those responsible for classroom computers and for IUAnyware are very slow to respond and install software.""There are still areas where wireless service is spotty, mostly in older buildings around lab space."The question concerning how important are UITS systems and services is disingenuous given that that is the only way to get nearly all of the service UITS provides."While UITS is a fairly broad reaching, enterprise unit at IU, I have been able to interact with several different people advancing and supporting the work of those on campuses. I have been satisfied with the interactions and collaborations, and have increased the amount that I rely on UITS to assist me in my role at IU."Would like to see Fax service become HIPAA compliant."Would like to thank the staff, they were always pleasant each time no matter how long the lines were. Wish they would continue the gas cards etc., also the unlimited amounts. 75 isn't enough when you eat off your card & provide gas for household."All my interactions and experiences were very good. Instant responses. Completely satisfied with the functioning of UITS."As a clinical research specialist working in the field, I needed tech setup (laptop, scanner, wireless hot-spot, etc.) upon my hire. As these things go, there were a few glitches in getting everything up and running. However, [IRD] (at the School of Nursing), was always quick to respond. He would come swiftly up to our office with a big smile, address any problems with ease, and has just been such a pleasure to work with. I often get frustrated with the things I don't have administrative privileges to set up on my computer (mapping to printers, installing needed software, etc.), but this frustration is lessened when I know there will be someone more than happy to come up and do this for me in a quick and courteous manner."Canvas messaging and discussions are very slow to update and are not as effective as other means of communication. We switched to text messaging for a group project to make sure everybody got the messages in our discussion without any time lag.Complete working hours on Saturday.Wi-Fi not accessible in every part of the lab.DUO is as annoying as it can get.DUO login is a waste of time for all the students."First of all, I am frustrated that certain labs are closed on weekends in Heron's main building. Secondly, I had an issue printing in one of Heron's labs (the large-scale printer produced an error message, didn't print my file, yet $20 was subtracted from my JagTag account). Most of the UITS employees could not help me and sent me from one to the next around campus. The level of experience and knowledge seems to range greatly in the UITS staff, and I have been frustrated several times. I have also sought out help and been met by closed doors when certain UITS offices were listed as ""Open."" On the whole, I have been very dissatisfied with the level of professionalism and availability exhibited on the IUPUI campus. I would not consider myself an expert regarding computers, but I am proficient, and at times, I felt I knew more than the UITS worker and had to help this person assist me with the computer."For the past three years I have had really great experiences with UITS. My Wi-Fi always works on my computer and my phone and I have heard of my classmates having issues but I have not had the same issues.I am happy with the services and the facilities offered at UITS. Please continue it all.I am very satisfied with the services and support offered by UITS. The staff were very helpful when I had technical difficulties accessing my google account which was required for my class discussion/Forum."I appreciate that UITS guides are online and available 24/7. However, the layout and accessibility of these is extremely convoluted and difficult to navigate. As well, though I have not had to in awhile, most direct interactions with UITS are not pleasant, as I feel talked down to."I don't have any comments at this time."I found Onestart and Oncourse very easy to navigate. I'm not too fond of one.iu.edu, particularly the more ""app"" or ""tiles"" style format, but I'm getting used to it. As of now, I have very little experience with Canvas, so I have no comment on whether it is better or worse.""I had 2 different problems, more on the technical side, and in both the cases, the person who helped me was quite friendly and the solution they provided worked.""I'd like to say, though, that documentation about double authentication on the UITS website doesn't cover all the user cases. For example, I had installed the app and registered for Duo last semester before it was compulsory, but later I deleted it. And when it got compulsory, even after installing the app I was not able to register for double authentication because it was sending the notification to the app that was uninstalled, and there was no way to change my preferences from app to call me. And I couldn't find any documentation to overcome the issue on official website."I had a great experience with UITS during orientation. They were helpful in getting my computer set up for an online program. The only thing I would recommend is more services for distance students or more advertising for distance services already available. When I have issues during the semester I don't really know how to get UITS help or even if it available from a distance."I had a very positive interaction with an IT person - I wish I could remember his name - maybe [IRD]? I am in the Exec Masters in Philanthropy program and all my classes are online. I had to engage with a listening thread and it wasn't loading. Of course I was exasperated and frustrated so I called the IT folks and miraculously he helped fix the issue. My browser, Chrome, was not allowing the thread to load so I had to switch to Mozilla.""I had trouble getting access to SPSS through IU Ware, but the IT tech helped me and he was very nice.""I hate Kaltura and Echo360. They are glitchy, sometimes quit, and have annoying interfaces."I find the discussion forum part of Canvas infuriating. It's an integral part of some of my classes and I don't think it's an effective mode of communication."I think the Wi-Fi is great, the software available is helpful, printing on campus is easy, Onestart gets the job done, and the tech chat is also good.""I have had generally positive experiences with UITS staff. I did have a negative experience where I was not able to upload a document for a class assignment, but the teacher later corrected this for me when I emailed her about the problem. I would appreciate it if general discussion boards in Canvas would initially include an option to upload materials, since the written posts for my assignments on the discussion boards in my classes are generally quite long.""I have had generally positive experiences with UITS. They respond quickly when I have had in-class issues, they have helped me when my account was compromised by a phishing email, they pick up the phone and are able to answer questions quickly and helpfully. I have also found the UITS folks to be really friendly. I have not ever had a negative experience with UITS."I have had positive experiences when I have called in for technology support and help."I have never had a chance to interact with any UITS staff but as far as I have heard they are very efficient. Apart from interaction, I have used different services provided by UITS."I have not had any issues with UITS."I have nothing but positive experiences with UITS. Every time I call or need a tech, someone responds appropriately and I receive the help I need. I would not wish to work with any other technology group on campus.""I haven't really had any interactions with the staff. If I had any complaints, I would say the computers take a long time to boot up. Also Canvas could be a little smoother to navigate.""I like everything of UITS except the job submission system. Karst/Bigred2/Mason have their own job submission requirements, which make things trickier."I love it when y'all do screen share and fix all my problems. Greatly appreciate it. Keep doing what you all are doing!"I love that I can ask almost any question and be directed to someone who can work with me on the issue until resolution. I also appreciate that UITS is always proactively forward-thinking and ensures that the IU community has access to the best products, especially through IU Anyware.""I recommend that UITS have a link put on Canvas. It was easy to find on the old Oncourse, but I fumbled around looking for help on Canvas.""I tried to solve this problem by phone, email submission, and finally in person. Being able to talk to a real person made all the difference and everything was all cleared in up minutes.""I wasn't able to find antivirus from IU ware. I do not like the fact that marks are posted on the very first page of canvas. In some courses like [IRD], one student has to sign in for the group assignment. This is done through Canvas. Once they sign in to Canvas, the other students in the group can see their marks for their last exam which to me is a violation of privacy. The marks should not be displayed on the homepage of Canvas."I will say when I started my online program I was worried about the technology end of it. Would I be able to understand and navigate the software? Would my IT problems be handled quickly since I wasn't on campus? How well would the systems work? Questions like that. Overall I'm extremely pleased with it. Everything was easy to understand and use and problems were fixed quickly. That's one thing I tell people who ask about my online program-The technology side of it was a breeze. IU and IUPUI know what they're doing when it comes to offering degree programs 100% online."I would like to be able to control canvas notifications by class. I'm an aide for a class, and don't need to have notifications for when assignments are turned in, but can't shut them off without shutting off all notifications. "Mobile.print.iu.edu has bugs that need worked out.I'm impressed that there is 24/7 service."I'm disappointed that there are too many multifaceted and complicated portals, sites, and apps with the conglomerate school: IU, IUPUI, IUSM, IUSB, IUSM-SB."Perhaps this could be simplified by being subdivisions under one umbrella?"As an [IRD], I have seen how Notre Dame uses the google interface with email. This can link communicate better with my macmail and gmail browsing in general than microsoft outlook. I prefer anything google.""It has worked well, but I often have trouble finding things I need to find on the website. It seems very convoluted and unnecessarily busy. I wish there was a way to only get what I need for MY campus, not all IU campuses."IU Box has some issues with updating other people's information. It is also a hassle to have to save and upload everything to put it into box. I do not like google docs but prefer this to box at this time for it is easier.I've had good experiences with UITS Staff. They are always helpful in helping me determine what my computer issues or software issues may be.Just not impressed that there's no way to control the 400 junk emails I get every day in my junk folder. It's only with my IU account. No one could help me."Last year, the law school printers offered a duplex printing option but that option has disappeared this year. For both environmental and simple space/quantity of pages concern, it would be helpful if this printing returned to the law school library. Also, the new OneIU page to access things such as OneStart, financial aid, etc. was confusing and felt like it was rolled out without notice or clear instructions on how to now access those services."lynda.com was really helpful."My biggest complaint is the Wi-Fi connection - it is often spotty and will disconnect my devices at random which leaves me in the dark on information I need, especially while I'm in class. This occurs with both the AT&T network and the IU Secure network (not sure if they use the same server/provider). I have never liked AT&T Internet as a non-business user and feel that students could get a much better ISP for the price we pay, especially since reliable, high-speed internet is a must on a college campus.""My one, and maybe only, complaint is regarding the Canvas system and some of its user interface scenarios."N/AN/ANonenone"Now that I am familiar with it, I like Canvas. I appreciate that I can use it on my apple devices. My only suggestion would be to make wireless printing easier. At the law school, it is nearly impossible to get wireless printing to work."Please start working with Lynda again.Remove Duo Login from Canvas.Services are fine for my needs."So many ""systems"" and constant changing...Oncourse and Onestart and CAS and Canvas and another here and another there...this is ridiculous. Then your prof. asks you to use one he likes (TWEN)...c'mon man...so many different places and passwords and nonsense.""Sometimes it takes them a long time to respond to emails. Is UITS staff the same as SOShelp? If so, please respond to my requests sooner."The wireless reception is crappy sometimes too. Thanks for reminding me.The confusing part was when I kept receiving prompts to do the two-step login over and over again."The graduate students should have the allowance of printing 1,000 pages per semester. It is not fair to the respective schools (i.e. Liberal Arts) to have to pay for their graduate students to have such an allowance. This should be allowed by the university, just as it is allowed for the undergraduate students."The only comment I would make is to maintain the same kind of software in every computer. I have had the problem where I work in an adobe suit program in the 24 hour lab in the first floor or in the Graduate Lab in the fourth floor and when I bring that project to Marla or to 255 I cannot open it because the rooms have two different versions of the program."If every computer will have not only the same programs, but the same versions of them, it will be easier to work. ""Also please give immediate building access to students (especially graduate). This is my second semester here and I still don't have building access. I have requested it at least four times or more but I still have not gotten access. Sometimes I work until late and I'm forced to stay in the building because I cannot go out. Also if I want to come back on a late time to work at night I can't, and it is frustrating.""The services by far are good. UITS staff and services give the technical assistance as and when I have the need and have been a great help at peak times. I appreciate the effort. Continue the good work. The only concern is the computers take a lot of time to login. If anything can be done about it, it would be great."Thanks.The staff is patient and helpful and always solve my problems.The UITS staff was very helpful! Two gentlemen worked with me and they were very kind and did everything they could to solve my issue. It did take a little while for them to get back to me though."The UITS website is very informative and user friendly. I've used it several times to look up how to do something, like how to use IU Secure on my new phone. The IUWare website is also very user friendly. I also emailed UITS recently regarding a IUWare question and really appreciated the quick and thorough response.""This is a little thing, but I would like a way for our grades not to be shown on the dashboard of Canvas under ""Recent Feedback"" when we sign in. When I log in to Canvas during class, I intentionally scale down the size of my browser to hide my scores from people sitting behind me. It would be nice to have a setting I could change telling Canvas not to display ""Recent Feedback"" on the dashboard when I first log in.""UITS has been particularly important to me, an off-campus student. EVERY time I have called, the staff have been courteous, kind, and consistently helpful. They stayed with me until I understood and often walked me through the process for which I sought help. Because I have not been on campus more than a few times, UITS serves as an important representative of the IUPUI campus. UITS support has left me feeling welcome, included, and wanted as an IUPUI student. Thank you very much for such a positive experience!""UITS is nice. Once, I couldn't install Matlab student version, a staff at UITS helped my to work on it for 3 hours, by searching and checking every possibilities online. Though, the problem was not solved, I so appreciated his help."One suggestion. "Some computers could save my work for the whole semester after I logged out, but some will delete it immediately. I didn't know that and couldn't distinguish them."Could we put a clear reminder next to the computer?"Once I was working on a class project on one of our computers, and wanted to continue the next day. My works were all gone the next day, because I used a wrong computer.""UITS lab is a great place to work for me. The quiet zone is maintained quiet properly. However, the vending machine needs to be fixed as it doesn't read the jagtag. Also, the number of 2 screen workstations should be increased."UITS should be available all the time 24/7 for students to use and study.I use and like the collaboration rooms. It would be nice if the rooms had long white boards all over the wall."Being HCI students, we should get full access to AR/VR lab. All the latest technology devices like wearables and smart watches should be available for us to play with and test our designs. Usability test labs should be available with Eye tracking, audio/video recording etc. equipment.""Classrooms should be more of Auditorium form, present classrooms are inconvenient for us to interact with Professors, TA and watch Keynotes on the projector. They are not even feasible to interact with whole class."UITS staff attend to the students' need promptly. I believe they are doing good job.UITS was very helpful to me on a number of occasions.Very good IT service."When I had questions specific to IU School of Medicine technology, the UITS staff either were unable to answer or gave incorrect answers (specifically in regards to IU Notify and One.IU access - because Medical School starts a number of weeks before undergraduate but we have access at the same time so cannot complete some One.IU tasks in advance of our first Orientation day). Otherwise, the students have been helpful in answering questions about locating services online, different software suggestions, and privacy. I love the online web chat! It has been most helpful in answering questions quickly that are straightforward."Three of the librarians in Med Sci were unfamiliar with how the printers work and what paper goes in the printers. Librarians should be trained to use the UITS hardware to a reasonable degree."There are rooms in Med Sci and Emerson which do not support internet access (to Canvas and TopHat) when all 100+ medical students attempt to access internet at once. In particular, the Pathology Labs in Med Sci do not have any internet access very regularly. Some students have limited access and other students have none.""When I had trouble getting my DUO access to work, I received quick help all over chat which was very convenient. Typically though I can solve most of my problems with the resources IT provides on iupui websites (like setting up my email and changing important passwords and making my email work on mobile devices).""Whenever I have needed help with issues IT has been there, even on the weekend.""While I do think that UITS provides excellent products, there are definite areas for improvement. I would appreciate more integration of services into one.iu like accessing Canvas or e-mail services. It would be great if you could login just once and never have to input that again. I am very disappointed with DUO. It has definitely been a significant time drain."A. easy way to print from cell phones.Printers aren't always the best.Computers on first floor of LD need to be faster. It takes forever to login .Printer needs to be in SELB building.Add more study rooms on campus or in the library. The first floor could use some if not more. The ability to record a speech needs to be evaluated. Speeches are getting longer and the media files say they are too large. We are permitted to either record or record and upload. The upload is having issues with file size. Please fix this. "Dell computers in the library randomly restart often, and it's annoying when you are in the middle of work or an assignment that you don't know if it was saved or not."Mac mouses are super slow and don't glide as easily as the windows computers.All computers need to have the software necessary. There should not be computers in the ET building that lack programs like Solidworks.All of my experiences have been helpful and positive."All services provided are easily accessible and equally helpful. However, there is a learning gap/curve with a handful of professors using Canvas which is frustrating for students at times."Always good!"As a student employee who has known this campus for over 5 years, I have a good understanding of our technology services, and how they are perceived by incoming students. I think Umail is a wonderful service, and offers everything and more that Box offers. But the userid@umail.iu.edu address is very confusing for new users. Furthermore, Umail's inability to set send-as addresses is frustrating, because I prefer to market my email address as userid@iupui.edu, yet when I send from the Umail interface, it will send or respond with userid@umail.iu.edu. I think this should be technically feasible considering the Umail interface is nearly identical to the widely used Gmail interface and both are developed and provided by Google.""Canvas Duo is such a hassle, especially since I have classes that require all tests to be taken at the testing center. It makes it a lot harder to log into Canvas to take exams, which would be stressful enough by themselves without the added stressor that Duo brings. Also, I don't like that you need to download another app just to access Canvas or financial information. Most of us don't have unlimited phone storage.""Computers on campus take a long while to log into, especially in SL building."Computers will freeze and not save important work.Double side printing on mac computers at the library."DUO is terrible. It makes accessing the testing lab a complete pain and if your phone dies you are unable to access One.IU or Canvas until you have a charge again, meaning if you need to access assignments or emails you can't. It also makes clocking in and out of work stressful if your phone is dead because you can clock in late due to a dead battery and be penalized."Free software.HAVE UITS STAFF SERVICE LOCATIONS AT MULTIPLE PLACES THROUGHOUT CAMPUS! SOME PLACES WHERE THERE ARE COMPUTERS THERE IS NO CELL SERVICE SO YOU CANNOT CALL TO REPORT IT!"Haven't had any interaction with UITS lately. Last semester I had recently reset my passphrase, and when I needed to log in to take an exam I couldn't get in. UITS staff was very helpful and friendly.""Having never taken an on-line class before, I had some trepidation about approaching a class where I'd never meet a classmate, the teachers or the TAs. It was not as harrowing an experience as I expected. Connections have been very dependable. I have no complaints.""I have not interacted much with support, but when I have, I've been able to resolve issues with their help fairly quickly."I am a new student and have just started my art and technology classes. I am so far quite satisfied with the level of service I have been experiencing.I am happy about everything to date and I will definitely let know the faculty members in the future about any inconvenience."I am in [IRD] quite often studying and have observed a couple UITS workers who do an exceptional job at keeping the computer chairs pushed in and the environment clean. However, I would like if all the computers in the ET basement were up to date and each contained the same programs(CREO, Multisim, Microsoft Visual Studios, etc.).""I am not a technologically savvy individual. I don't really know what UITS services provide, but I'm aware that I use them every day (Mon-Fri); using Wi-Fi on my personal device, logging into the campus network, email, etc. As somebody who doesn't really know what I should do if something goes wrong, I'm glad that I've never had to encounter any issues in the time I've been here!""I am really impressed with the motives the UITS take in offering sufficient service to students. The staff I have encountered know what they are doing and they are really polite. For me, I think they are good and they offer a good service to students.""I believe that UITS has done a fabulous job at helping this campus, be an accessible and learning environment. I used Canvas in high school as well, so using it in college is great for me. I do not have to worry about not being able to navigate any assignments, notes or discussions from my classes. ""UITS is also a great help, if I ever need anything done technology wise, such as internet or computer problems, they are a great help. "Thank you! [IRD]I dislike the hours being cut to the 24 hour lab. I frequently use it late into the evening since everywhere else on campus is closed. Since I work and go to school it's the only time I often have to work on homework and I can't do that now.I do not have any problems with UITS staff or services."I do not have very many recommendations for new services, but some improvements that could exist would be personal communication via FaceTime/video source from home if an issue with technology occurred that needs step-by-step guidance that is processed by UITS staff members.""I do not like the Duo two step program to log onto canvas. It complicates things way too much. (Especially at the testing center.) I'm not worried about people getting on my account, so the double log on frustrates me.""I don't frequently use the resources presented by IT on campus, but it is reassuring knowing that if I were to have a problem that there are people willing and ready to help.""I feel that UITS does a fine job however the computers in the IT building lab literally take 5 mins to sign in. Don't believe me, try it yourself. That may not seem like a big deal but it is when you need to get something done. I would either buy new computers with an i7 instead of an i5 or update the system that they run on together but it's ridiculous. Another part of the problem is that you have every program imaginable installed on every computer. Autodesk is huge, all Adobe programs just a little much to me. You could offer specific computers with those functions possibly?""I had an issue with downloading software to my laptop, the UITS guy helped me via chat the best he could. However I still had to wait till the following day to get my software to download"I hate the two step log in.I have dealt only with highly knowledgeable and competent workers throughout the resolution and completing of all of my tech needs at IUPUI.I have had a very satisfactory experience with UITS services. I've been especially pleased with the computer services people in the IT building. If I had any suggestions it would be to perhaps odddffer a basic hardware tutorial session for studentsI have had all positive experiences with UITS and the staff. No recommendations.I would be interested in the focus group if compensation was given to participants."I have had multiple issues negative instances with UITS staff. For example, the printers at the Campus Center were not working. They were flashing a red light. It wouldn't print my paper. I called UITS and the lady said it would take approximately 20 minutes. I needed the paper printed sooner. It wasted 20 of my prints. Also, the printer at the Riverwalk Apartments did not work. There are signs all over that say ""Call UITS for help""... so I called UITS. The guy on the phone could not even recognize what printer I was at. He said it was not a real printer. I wasted another few prints. I have since returned to try again and it did not work.""I have never been able to connect my phone to the IU Wi-Fi and I'm not sure how to, I wish there was sort a tutorial somewhere like on the library page on how to get connected. Also why do the Outlook accounts disable after we graduate, I think students should be informed of this because I tend to use my IUPUI email for most everything since I began here, so it is very inconvenient that I will no longer have access to my email."I have never met anyone from UITS.I have not received any help from them.I have twice printed out big packets and the printer put big black streaks down the center of the pages towards the end of the packets both time.Information on how to print from a personal computer would be helpful."I have visited IT in the Campus Center, the IT bldg., as well as phone contact. Each time, the IT have been extremely helpful with my situation.""I haven't had any interactions with UITS staff in the past year, but all the technology that I've used has been fine. However, the Wi-Fi doesn't usually work as well as I would like.""I haven't had any problems with the people, but some of the computers in the library aren't working.""I haven't had much experience dealing with the UITS staff. Often times in classrooms, however, they were needed to fix a computer. This happened almost daily that a computer wasn't working. Eventually, it got to the point where the classroom was completely full and I couldn't use a computer since about 3 of them were broken. This kept me from doing my homework in there for over 10 minutes. Most of the time the printers work across campus. However, the printer on the bottom floor of the science building is often times breaking down and needing repairs. Only recently have I actually been able to use it. The same goes for the computers in that area. Really slow and login times are very long. In my current physics lab, all of the computers are outdated and very slow. They seem to have been here for multiple years of thorough use."I haven't had the honor to work with UITS yet."I haven't used UITS many times but the times I have, it's been positive. They're very knowledgeable and make sure you understand what they're doing to help you, in terms that you understand."I had a positive experience when I re-enrolled at IUPUI but my name had changed. I needed to get a new student email and the IT staff was very helpful and managed to do it quickly.I love the campus computers and computer labs. I also love the library. The computers are huge and I love being able to have a word document and the internet open on split screen. On campus is my favorite place to study and do homework."I love using the Knowledge Base, so I have had few interactions with UTIS on campus help."I spend the majority of my time in the nursing building and Wi-Fi availability could be better there."I think UITS staff is very good. I had no problems with my experiences with them. When I asked my questions, they were able to help right away. I recommend them to everyone who has questions.""I think the testing center takes away the ability to think during tests. I find that in the testing center I am looking around the room, looking at the staff, and rushing through my test. I think there should be an option to sit in a room by yourself or have the ability to write your tests.""I think there should be more times offered for the IT Training classes. I could not participate in some classes which I really wanted to take, because I had my regular classes to attend at that time."I wanted to scan a document and needed help. The equipment prompts were not helpful so went to a help desk and the person had no idea how to scan a document. WHAT? How can an employee not know or have access to a tutorial to assist in helping me. He was useless and I had to get help from someone not associated with the UITS department. Silly right?I wish it was bigger and had more people working.I wish the Wi-Fi was better during peak times. I also would like there to be access to the Adobe Cloud software for free."I work with them a lot, they are always helpful.""I would recommend having more work stations with 2 monitors. As an engineering student I have lots of reference material, eBooks, and googling to do while I am working on a project. I could work much more efficiently without switching between different windows all of the time. I would also recommend putting, solid works, autocad, and ANSYS available on IU anyware."Improve Canvas."In some of the IUPUI buildings, internet does not work very well. It makes wasting our time by waiting for the time to speeding up of it. Thanks.""In the beginning of the year, I was having trouble turning in assignments through Microsoft Edge. I went to the desk at the campus center, and was helped immediately. The man helped me find what the issue was, then helped me download a different browser to use. It was very quick and efficient service.""In the student self service center, the class search is not at all intuitive. I struggle with it every time I am trying to find a class even if I know the course number."It would be helpful if one.iu.edu could be offered as a phone app as well to make certain functionalities available/easier to use on the phone."Canvas is great for class organization! Along with one.iu it's my favorite school interface thing I've had access to so far. However the recent crashes have made taking tests, turning in assignments, and studying difficult. Considering classes rely so heavily upon canvas, if it doesn't work it can feel like our education or the class has to stand still until the issue is fixed. ""Printing has been a big issue this semester. Many wireless printers (in the library especially) have printed empty pages, lines instead of words, or just do not print at all. This interfered with being prepared for classes. It was also upsetting considering we are required to pay a set amount of money in order to use these printers each semester. I expect IUPUI to offer functioning services if I'm being expected to pay for those services."IUPUI ET building needs new lab computers."I've only ever had a few experiences with UITS. The first was trying to figure out what computers on campus had the software Maple. The first person I went to, who was in the basement of ET, didn't really tell me where to go so I went to check IT and saw another person there and directed me to the computers in the SL/LD lobby. The second time was online, trying to figure out how get the Citrix receiver to work. The person I was chatting with helped me through the entire process as well as sending me the knowledge base page to deal with the people."I've used the main computer lab before and found the noise of others talking and playing music very annoying.Laptops in psychology lab rooms are old and slow and sometimes do not work.My main concern is the ability of the IU Secure Wi-Fi access points and if they can actually handle so many devices at once.My only experience with UITS is through the web. The One portal and with Canvas for online courses. I've been generally pleased with the One portal and related apps. The Canvas system appears to be good for distributed learning for the most part. But I've been disappointed with the quality/age of the videos and the technology to play them.The lecture videos for the [IRD] class appear to be 7-10 years old or more. I realize this is a class specific issue but it reflects on the overall technological perception of IU.I really wish the video player technology would remember where you left off on a particular video between sessions and devices. It's very frustrating to watch part of a lecture and then have to scroll/scan through the lecture to a certain time when returning to it later and/or on a different device.My personal laptop will not connect to IU SECURE Network and I have to use the AT&T Wi-Fi and it was an inconvenience but that was about the only thing that I had an issue with.N/AN/aN/An/aNo comment."No issues, they always help me with my tech problems."No recommendations."No, I do not have any issues."NonenoneNoneNone."Once, I was unable to figure out why two different videos on canvas were pulling up the same feed, and a UITS staff was able to view my screen and figure out the issue. One thing that can be frustrating at times, is how I am unable to connect to the WIFI to do homework assignments. Sometimes its in the middle of the day, others its at night. I know technology can have glitches, but it can be frustrating when I am trying to accomplish tasks."Overall good experiences. Have experienced dead zones of Wi-Fi services within numerous building on the IUPUI campus. Most notability IT. I'd recommend preforming some form of signal integrity evaluation of coverage within buildings."One.iu is much better than OneStart, however I think the number of ""apps"" could be reduced or at least clustered/categorized to reduce clutter and make it easier to find the service you are looking for without having to search for it. ""Canvas is better than OnCourse, but I think the messaging service should be more integrated within the courses.""Overall interaction with any UITS staff has been helpful. Availability of screen recording software for us to use would be ideal (like the instructors use), or training for all of them to know how to use it. I just had to purchase a subscription to Screencastify (a plug-in for Chrome) to record screen and audio.""Overall, my experience has been positive. For the most part, staff has been available to come quickly when I have a problem with the printer or computer on campus. I'm super impressed with the wireless charging in the IT building in the computer lab. I would love to see some of that in buildings closer to the center of campus, because I am a liberal arts student and I don't have any classes in that building.""Please get rid of the two-step login. It is annoying and unnecessary. I understand that I need it to access my employment information through Indiana University, but I feel my password is more than long enough to make me feel secure.""Provide more cleaning products to clean off desks, keyboards, monitors in labs. Not all labs are cleaned (appropriately or at all) by staff. [ex: library is very dirty, but I do not think UITS is involved in sanitizing library computers.]""Since attending IUPUI in the Fall of 2015, I have not had any issues with UITS staff or services. Any problems that I may have encountered have been professionally addressed and rectified by UITS staff personnel. They have taken the time to listen to my concerns and have appropriately helped me in overcoming any problems in a timely manner."Some computers like the ones in the Print Shop at Herron are incredibly slow. Often they take over 10 minutes to open up."Staff are always helpful and nice. Although, sometimes they are a bit loud (especially in the IT building lab on the first floor) which can be distracting. It is also unfair because students get told to lower their voices, yet the staff is often loud.""The computers on campus take a long time to logon to, it would be nice if they were faster.""The Duo process seems good and ideal to protect our information, but whenever my phone is down, or I do not have internet, or my phone is simply not with me, how am I supposed to get access to my canvas?"The employees are typically quite nice.The internet access still needs to be improved.The printing system on personal MacBook still didn't work. Makes it difficult sometime.The internet in University Tower is horrible. It is super slow and is always crashing. Also when I try to log into Xfinity on Campus it always says that I am not connected to campus internet.The IT system that IUPUI uses seems quite well put together and user-friendly. I have yet to have to use any more than some very basic functions though. The one thing that could use some major improvement would be a password secured Wi-Fi that is thoroughly supported and boosted across campus allowing greater usage of personal devices."The new unified printer driver system is hit and miss, especially in the ET building. Also, IU Secure packet throttling is a bit heavy-handed."The search engine for classes within one.iu.edu for registering classes is horrible. That has been my only problem when it comes to technology at IUPUI. There should be a better way to search for classes with specific key terms just like on any search engine. My searches were always too broad or too specific so finding courses was a pain and took longer than it should have. I ended up using the websites of various schools to find out what courses they offered and generally when and from there checked the class search engine for specific times and teachers."The self service center needs to be mobile friendly. I do pretty much everything on my phone. I am constantly out running errands etc. and busting out a 15"" laptop every time I want to browse class offerings or check on my registration to do's etc. is not practical. I wish I could use igps and self service on my phone. Sometimes it works, sometimes its impossible. ""Umail is frustrating because there is no way to connect it to my phone email either. I cannot receive emails through my phone email or view it easily or quickly through iu mobile. IU mobile I can at least access it, but it's a 3 or 4 step process. ""I did set up my umail to forward everything to my private school only email address, but it hasn't worked so far."The staff had been great. I did have some trouble using my jagtag to access the lab. Not too sure why? user name [IRD]"The UITS staff is fantastic. Their response time and expertise have gotten me out of some technological conundrums as well as helped me purchase and encrypt hardware for our overseas sites. As for services, the electronic fax system is very efficient and definitely takes the hassle out of the faxing process.""The wireless network can get bogged down sometimes, and some of the computers in the ET building have really slow loading times occasionally."There are a moderate amount of Wi-Fi dead zones in lots of buildings.There should be at least one printer that is easily accessible in every building or on every floor.They are all very helpful."They are so very helpful!! Every time I've come to them with a problem or called them, they have been there to solve the problem. Very reliable!"They were very helpful connecting with iusecure."Though it has been only once, the experience I had with the UITS staff and services was positive. I had several questions in regards to the IUware and all of my questions were resolved quickly by their services.""To be honest, I haven't had any interactions with UITS staff."UITS helped me download Creative Cloud and helped me work through the issues I ran into while installing said program. The employee was very helpful and gave me good pointers and instructions.UITS services has been great.UITS staff are typically very quick to respond to technology issues I have and come to my office to help the same day or the next. I also think it is easy to submit a tech request.UITS staff I have come in contact with have always been helpful and fixed my problems. I appreciate that most of them do not do the 'hand holding' which means they make the patron do the steps themselves so the patron can learn how to use a system or fix the problem if it happens again."UITS staff is great - always friendly and helpful. IU Secure, as a network, is terrible sometimes. I will be in the middle of campus and just get kicked off the network. This is especially troublesome when I'm trying to complete assignments for my online classes.""UITS staffs are very helpful and friendly. My only concern is the scan machine. I had some trouble using it to scan a book, but no very few librarians are able to help me solve the problem."University Tower's printed in their computer lab has been down all year long. Please get this back!"Well sometimes when some electronic appliance does not work, I have informed UITS staff to take look at it and their usual response is that they will check it out later. And the next day it is still the same, nothing is fixed. I don't know whether they have taken a look at it or not. It might be that they don't know how to fix it, but this is one thing I am concern about.""When I had to get my Duo token because my phone was acting up, the staff at the campus center and IT were very helpful in getting me what I needed and how to get it.""When the campus first started using two-step login, I didn't have my token with me and didn't have my DUO Mobile set up in my phone. I called UITS at 10pm and had really good service. The agent was very helpful and patient, and my problem was solved in 15 minutes.""While it is understandable if it is not currently feasible, please consider adding support for the steam link. Also, some parts of some campus buildings do not get sufficient connections to IU secure. Consider using Wi-Fi extenders like in the dorm rooms. It makes a huge difference and they are relatively cheap.""While using a University Library computer, I was IM'ing one of the UITS helpdesk staff. There were minutes between replies. I hope to not sound picky as it could have been the connection."WHY IS THE 24 HOUR LAB SO FREEZING COLD ALL THE TIME?I ACTUALLY HAVE TO STOP AND GO OUT TO MY CAR AND WARM UP AND THAT IS VERY TIME CONSUMING. I USE UR LAB BECAUSE I HAVE TO NOT BECAUSE I WANT TO. I JUST DONT UNDERSTAND WHY YOU PEOPLE NEED IT FREEZING COLD IN THERE YEAR ROUND."With the addition of streaming TV instead of cable, Wi-Fi has been slower."You are doing a great job."I understand there can be problems with my older computer, but I wish the Wi-Fi connection could be strong and consistent throughout the entire library. There are occasional dead spots or areas where it might occasionally be harder to connect with IU secure (especially on the third floor)."Do what is asked for rather than dictating protocols that interfere with the primary functions of the university."I've had mixed experiences with UITS staff. Some are very helpful and pleasant, others are neither of those things. Sometimes, I must request assistance or information multiple times before UITS responds or resolves an issue."I suggest that UITS confer with faculty regarding the software offered through IUWare.I would like to see more in-person training options.N/AThey are friendly and helpful. No negative experiences. No recommendations.UITS on my campus seem VERY understaffed. They are focusing all their time on major classroom disruptions and are barely able to keep up with smaller faculty requests.A major concern is the level of training the students at the Help Desk receive. They don't seem to be able to answer simple questions and seem confused about things. There seems to be very little communication between UITS and the rest of the campus as well.I have had only positive experiences with UITS staff and services in my month here."Telephone systems is not conducive to having multiple lines for a department. Very difficult to manage with multiple lines and multiple users (including student workers without dedicated numbers). Help desk doesn't get the best response, sometimes it takes a long time for them to figure out or respond to the issue. I normally do not call unless I have exhausted all my options. When there is an issue that impedes an interviewee on campus or a meeting taking place, it isn't always resolved before the meeting is complete. Help desk wants to do everything over the phone instead of coming to my desk, which is normally a lot quicker, but convincing them is difficult.""Usually, when I send an email to KOHelp, I get a response. However, there are times I send emails to certain individuals and receive no response.""I am very impressed with IU Kokomo's IT department. I set up an appointment back in December to have my computer uploaded with all the content it needed for me to be successful in my Master's program. [IRD] and [IRD] were extremely helpful in my computer set up. They both have very positive attitudes, answered all my questions, and provided helpful tips to make me successful.""I received thorough, excellent support services. Find the systems to be easy to access and navigate. Appreciate access to an outstanding internet library. Have not yet used all of the equipment, software, and additional services found on this survey.""So far, all the UITS staff have been very helpful. No concerns at all."They helped me set up my new computer. It was great since I have never owned a laptop until now."1. I seem to have printing issues often. It could just be me, but it's none-the-less annoying. ""2. IUSecure seems to randomly stop functioning at certain points. I never get disconnected, but the internet doesn't work.""Canvas seems to have a bug where it will not show the overall grade for a class, even though grades have been submitted."Wi-Fi connection is terrible no matter where I am on campus. It never stays connected."Even though the printers are downloaded on my computer, I have never been able to print from my personal laptop. It is just unneeded if it is not going to be used then if I cannot print."Getting issues is very time consuming and often takes several days. The IUK campus received new printers over the Winter Break and instead of installing them when no students were on campus IT decided to wait until the first week of classes to install the printers causing confusion and serious printing issues for students. "Several of the ""old style"" printer stations were still left around campus for about a month despite them not working at all and the Science building did not have student accessible printers for 3 weeks causing students to have to hike to the Library in order to print. Despite all of these issues several of the printers still have issues printing from student laptops as well despite IT being notified on multiple occasions. ""Then the IT department just hired a new Associate Director of IT who has no formal education in IT at all, he has an MBA now I am by no means a computer server expert but an MBA does not prepare someone to be a server admin."I am pleased with how UITS is currently. I have never had a bad experience with them and I greatly appreciate the service."I find that the staff on hand is helpful with upholding IT information and making sure that the campus is working, but they are incredibly slow at responding and the Wi-Fi still seems to work only 20% of the time without kicking off the students. It is very disappointing and frustrating as a paying student.""I have always had great experiences with UITS staff at IUK, especially the student assistants. I think that during the beginning of new semesters it would be nice if more than one person could be working the desk, as it always seems there is a long line up during the first few weeks."I have had pleasant experiences with the UTIS staff in fixing issues I have had with my computer or when my card wasn't working for printing.My biggest issues with IT is that printing is very difficult because not all printers work and sometimes the card readers don't work and it is confusing as to when you can and can not use your card for the printing. I hope they get the printing system fixed soon.I know the CAS.I think the services provided are beneficial and helpful for students that are not experts in technology. It would be better if the staff would take more time in explaining how to download the software when the student is a freshman for future reference. The Wi-Fi connection needs to be more reliable around campus. I always have difficulty connecting to Wi-Fi in Hunt Hall."I would like to see further Box integration with IU services, especially Canvas. Adding functionality for a Box file upload in assignments or direct import of files into Box accounts would help encourage the wider use of Box at IU."Make the Wi-Fi network strong enough to allow my computer to stay logged in without having to reconnect every 10 minutes.Positive experiences with staff and student workers.Only negative experiences with UITS has been with connectivity issues to the Wi-Fi network.The IU secure internet never works. The only way I can use internet on campus is to connect to some AT&T network.The new log in system I think is very unnecessary. I have been at this university for 4 years and have been simply fine with the log in system. But having to send a approval code to log in is just frustrating. Especially when it happened all randomly and not expected.The only complaint that I have is that many of the printers on campus have not been working properly.The staff was very helpful and I did not have to wait long to get the help I needed.There should be more than 1 window. I had to wait 20 minutes for a problem that took 5 minutes to fix."Typically, UITS staff are very prompt to respond to IT issues. There have been a couple of instances where they were needed immediately to assist in setting up a video conference before it started and they did not arrive prior to the meeting beginning. I'm sure they are busy all over campus, but it can be frustrating when the equipment does not work the way it is supposed to in the conference rooms.""UITS Staff are very polite, helpful, and prompt with services.""When I first came to IU Kokomo, I was nervous about getting a new computer, and learning how to use it. The guys in the IT, helped me. The helped me download things I needed, and helped me realize some things about my laptop. They made me less nervous about scoping out my laptop. I am very thankful for this service. I would like to learn more about the UITS services.""Although this is my first year here at IUS, I have been very pleased with the services I have received. Everyone has been attentive listeners and have provided solid solutions to any obstacles I have had."I do not like the two-step login.I find the staff to be very supportive. Any time I have had an issue or needed assistance they have always been efficient and helpful in solving it."I have had nothing but excellent experiences with UITS staff. I think, however, Canvas never should have been adopted. It is inferior to Oncourse in my opinion. It has been a step backward, unfortunately.""I know you probably have phase-in schedules for new equipment but in my humble opinion, the computers and technology in the School of Education section seem pretty dated/limited. Consider that future teachers are passing through courses in those rooms that have lower tech than what they will work with upon graduation. Because of the slightly different set of circumstances regarding the importance of technology for our future teachers, I wish they could be on an earlier replacement/update schedule.""I prefer to speak with the technology people at IUS. They know our campus and have ready solutions. ALWAYS ALWAYS when I end up with a Bloomington tech, they spend an hour with me on the phone NOT finding a solution and then give me the direct number for our techs who typically have the solution or understand our systems better and obtain the solution directly. It is wasting my time to have to be directed to the Bloomington tech support. So on the following survey you will get mixed reviews because I am very happy with IUS tech support. Not at all happy with Bloomington tech support."I use Skype (regular) for meetings with research teams from universities across the country and found that I have to use Skype online to do this (it's less than ideal)."I would like to create a faculty webpage, and have asked for help in from several sources. I am fairly tech savvy, but programming language is out of my wheelhouse. I've used the kb, but it is not in laymen's terms. It gets to a point that I no longer understand, and I've tried. There has to be a better way for faculty who want to develop a webpage. Maybe a template we can use to fill in the basics. Is there not something like WIX to develop it?""I would love to have the faculty email work on my phone. I can receive emails, however, I can't send them.""I've had great experiences with the staff in my 2 semesters as Adjunct Faculty. I've had to call for help a few times, and service was always prompt and courteous."Local support here is wonderful."When I have to deal with the Bloomington office, it is more hit and miss - primarily because they do not understand our unique needs / setups at the regional campuses. At times, I am told to wait until I can speak to a local person to get the help I need.""My experiences with UITS at IUS have been very good. They are quick to respond, effective, and friendly."My experiences with UITS from headquarters though have not been good. The roll out of our two step login changes was not user friendly. UITS is recommending hardware (the U2F token) that does not work with the Lenovo computers used in class rooms here at IUS."I was forced to buy a U2F with my own money, only to find out that it didn't work when I tried it in my classroom. I'm currently on a waiting list to receive a single button hardware token, but apparently UITS provided IUS with a total of 25 of those devices."25 for the entire IUS campus. Seriously."My general experience has been very positive. My concerns are with Canvas problems. As a new platform, it has been very challenging at times to troubleshoot student issues from my set up issues. Staff has done well with giving me step-by-step resolutions. My chief concern has to do with setting up groups in Canvas and the fact that there is no way to correct the groups if energetic students post ahead on future assignments."No comments.Our Campus (IU Southeast) IT services have always been tremendously helpful and available."Overall, I'm satisfied and very impressed with the quality of technological services on my campus, as well as with the broad range of technological resources available to me. The only thing I don't like is Duo, which requires that I carry my smart phone with me at all times, in case I need to log into Canvas or Box while teaching a class. That gets a bit annoying at times.""Since I am not currently teaching at the university, I am unable to express my opinion. I hope to return in the future. ""I will say that during the time I was on faculty, I found the technology support to be excellent. The department assisted me in every aspect I requested.""The UITS staff at IUS are polite, understanding, helpful, and efficient."It would be nice if I did not have to use Dual to first sign in on a classroom computer and then use Dual again to sign in to use Canvas on the same classroom computer. It is hard to do in a classroom with students wanting to talk with you before a class."Two concerns - 1. When new software or operating systems are installed in classroom computers, no instructions are given on how the new system differs from the old. I have wasted valuable class time trying to figure out things that operate differently than they did 24 hours earlier (such as playing videos linked in a Power Point presentation). 2. On two occasions, I've called IT for issues with classroom computers, only to be told the computer worked fine. I've confirmed with other faculty that it wasn't just me having the issues, so I know they weren't fine. The computer in KV 015 is a disaster to work with, for instance."Two relatively minor comments:"First, my classroom [IRD] does not have up-to-date controls for the projector (for use with the classroom computer and with my own tablet). Somewhat frustrating to use (inconvenient to find and use connections for my tablet).""Second, Canvas works well, but its interface is a bit clunky. I like long file names, and these do not display well in the file list box."I do not like this new Duo link stuff. It is a complete hassle to always have your phone to sign into E-mail and Canvas. I believe that this is the dumbest thing that has even been implemented at IU."I had a very positive experience when I came on as a new employee. UITS staff were extremely helpful, knowledgeable, and patient. I liked the Lynda.com courses."I hate the DUO two-step login.I have had nothing but positive experiences with UITS staff.I really appreciate the improved Wi-Fi service.The technical staff has been great to work with when I've need them.Really wish the auto start programs on Thursday could get moved back 5 minutes from 5:00 AM to 5:05 AM. It would make clocking in much easier."OMG, I am so delighted to take a moment and put into writing how much I love the IT department and the UITS staff at IU Southeast. Never, have they been too busy to help me and the students in the [IRD]. The staff is kind and gentle with the older students, very helpful and patient with me, and we really appreciate all they do to assist us with our work and studies. Writing this reminds me that it has been a while since I treated them to donuts on a Friday. Got to get on my game, here. :)"Our IT people here at IU Southeast are fantastic. They are prompt and knowledgeable and never leave a problem unsolved! They are polite and straightforward."Overall, I have been pleased with our IT support on the Southeast campus. However, when I have been forwarded to individuals in Bloomington for assistance, they have been clueless and not helpful at all. Numerous times I have had to hang up on them and call back to try to get a different person who knows what they are doing."The IU Southeast UITS staff are incredibly helpful. They consistently help before the desired completion date. My only suggestion would be having them call each person before showing up at their office.I also miss having access to Lynda.com. The self-paced learning materials on ittraining.iu.edu are mostly just pdfs. The videos were more helpful.The students who work with Technology service are kind and understanding to other students needs. They always conduct themselves in the best manner possible and do not stop until the problem is solved.The two-step login is inconvenient.The UITS staff is always friendly and extremely helpful. One critique would be that some of the services offered are not advertised well and the result is people like me only discover incredibly helpful tools their junior or even senior year.The UITS staff that I have interacted with here on the IUS campus have always been very helpful and courteous. They are always ready to help with any questions or requests that I have.This survey was entirely too long!UITS department is always friendly and efficient."UITS on the Southeast campus is extremely efficient and friendly. Like many of us they have a heavy workload but never fail to respond to tickets in a timely manner. When I have an issue, I always know that I am receiving service from highly qualified individuals."We have a great technology infrastructure. My only area of concern is the consistency of network performance. I would like to see a more proactive approach to monitoring network performance and addressing issues."When calling the help desk, they are often confused and not able to answer my questions. I get a better response when redirected to my local campus."When I call our campus number for IT support help and get Bloomington I request a work order to be placed for our campus (IU Southeast) because Bloomington is not familiar with problems we are having here on our campus.The phones are a problem when it rolls over then we cannot transfer the call. The menu does not give us the option to transfer. It gets embarrassing when we have to tell someone we cannot transfer the call.The Dual login is not very convenient. And I don't feel like it makes my information any more secure. My phone was stolen and I had no access to my account. That was frustrating. I am very busy and didn't really have the time to deal with that.The only issue I have ever had with technology at IUS is in room 200 of Hillside Hall as the computer and projector have issues working together at times. This has been a problem for two professors that I have had in this room.All the UITS staff I have interacted with have been quite helpful with their solutions.Computers in LS building have been having issues with linking to the printers. Half of them work and half don't. It is very frustrating.I called for help and the way she had me print my notes cost me $4."Duo does nothing but make it more of a hassle to sign in to anything campus related, and I can't use it if I left my phone at home.""I cannot download Microsoft programs onto my iPad because IU Ware doesn't work well with Apple. Also, I hate the new printer program because I have to search for the printers a lot which makes me late to class. It shouldn't take me 20 minutes to print off a document. Not to mention, for me to use the ArcMap program for GIS, I have to walk to a computer lab not particularly close."I do not have anything to add. I believe that IUS has very good technology on campus."I don't know that I have ever worked with UITS staff. If IUWare is a service I like it, however, when it comes to web based services (MS Visio, specifically) I have trouble accessing them both on campus and at home. I had added it to class machines I use every other day for class and for whatever reason it is gone when I come back and hard to access. This could be a Citrix issue. In the Hillside labs having monitors below a sheet of glass is uncomfortable to type on and hard to read. Both of the classes I've taken in this room did not benefit from this set up and made following along harder than a traditional set up.""I feel like the IU Ware is complicated to access. The instructions are vague. In lieu of a download, I was instructed to login via an online access for which I had to create an account, username and password. The first dozen times it seemed very cumbersome. I would much rather have been offered a simple download. "The good news: When I called for assistance the staff was patient and stayed on the phone with me until the software was completely operational.I appreciate having the ability to use online tutoring via the writing center using a video cam.I have no issues!"I haven't used them personally, but my professors have needed them to come in and fix the computers in the classroom and they are wonderful. They have helped both times and taught us what to do if it happens again.""I remember a member of UITS staff getting my laptop synced with the lab printer. This person was very helpful in getting me set up quickly as I had a paper due the same day and the document was only on my laptop. I didn't have time to download to an online drive and access another computer. It was also a pretty funny encounter. I saw him sigh in relief and say, ""Thank God- it's not a Chromebook."""I think it would be great if there was a color scanner on the IU Southeast campus. As far as I know there are only black and white ones.I think they are doing great. I wish in Canvas you could change colors in the calendar part so I could tell the difference when I make an event.I wish that game systems were easier to set up in terms of online service."I've had good results with the people with UITS. I have run into problems that I couldn't fix since I am not a Geek. Whenever I have a problem, mostly with my laptop, they are very willing to help me. You have one very happy customer when things go well. And I'm still learning what else they can do."Less surveys please and more free paper and printing money."My main frustrations are the amount of time it takes to log into a computer on campus, and the NIGHTMARE of finding a computer that is actually able to print to a print station. Also, thanks to the printers on campus being routinely over-filled, we have all learned how to disassemble a printer to remove a paper jam--so thanks for the life skill?"My Wi-Fi doesn't work.N/An/aN/AnonePlease be aware that the computers in [IRD] are often not working properly. And on several occasions we (several classmates and I) were not able to print to the printers in this area.Instructors are having issues logging into the system because of duo.Printers are often not connected to computers for student printing. Logging on to computers seems to only get longer. We have to enter half a dozen passwords to access anything through IU's portals. Problems with Canvas only continue to grow in number. The university accounts through google are horrendous. Administration has blocked all access to most of the useful add-ons.Printers are often not connected to the computers in the lodges."The duo sign in is, for lack of a better word, a pain. I don't always have my phone on me, and having to remember one more code as a student is more than likely not going to happen. I know that I am graduating, so I will not have to deal with it for much longer, but the duo sign in has made my last semester more stressful than it needed to be.""The IT support was able to aid me in figuring out a Canvas issue, and they almost always greet me when I enter the rooms where they are stationed.""The ongoing issue of printers disappearing from the computers in the computer labs causes quite a bit of frustration for myself and fellow students. Also, the lack of understanding that most professors have of how a computer works and how to link the devices has resulted in many times the IT people having to show up and fix it without explaining or teaching. Also, it is a known fact, and an overwhelmingly irritating one, that to log into any computer for the first time it takes anywhere from 5 minutes to 25 minutes, ranging to those that sometimes never log on that day. This delay is far more than we often have between classes, and it is extremely frustrating when we have to sit in front of a computer saying ""Preparing Windows..."" for 25 minutes, so much so that we are having to find ways to work around some of them and give up on others.""The printers disconnect from the computers provided by the university in the different lab locations on a regular basis. When they disconnect, they are often difficult to reconnect because of the enormous list of printers on the network. Therefore, if I am able to reconnect the printer it is after a long amount of time which is not always a luxury when trying to print off a paper quickly before class. Improving the network so that the computers and printers do not disconnect regularly would be advantageous in keeping the attitudes about the school positive."The printers in the life science building are infrequently connected to the computers."Also, it would be great if some formal training could be bestowed upon the staff that refills the printer trays, to simply throw the empty paper cases in the recycling bins instead of the trash cans (as I have witnessed countless times). As I can only imagine how many times this is replicated in a given day, this would greatly improve the recycling that is done on campus as I assume this is done on a rather large scale across campus. "Many Thanks!"The printers, at least in the biology building, have been really hit or miss. It's a pretty serious problem for a lot of us, who don't own printers."The staff is very helpful. It's mostly computer/printer errors that occur.The staff is very nice and helpful.The UITS staff helped me to set up an add block program to prevent unwanted adds from showing up on my laptop. The program has prevented adds from slowing my computer down. UITS also helped me to set up Canvas on my Android phone. I have no recommendations for now.The wireless network is ridiculously unreliable."They are always willing to answer general questions about IT when they are free, which is very enjoyable to have access to. Wish there was someone to speak to who was on campus more often, since IT at Bloomington does not necessarily have the ability to help with issues at Southeast."UITS has done a marvelous job. I love Canvas over Oncourse. Canvas is by far the best LMS that I have ever used. One.IU is very handy and Umail is very easy to use."Your system seems fine, but I don't have to actually use duo to log in, even though there was this push to get me to sign up for it. That seemed a bit weird.""I don't use the Wi-Fi network with my personal devices, because it's completely unsecured. The hardwired Ethernet network is fine though, haven't had any issues so far.""I really like IUanyWare for accessing software; however, when I try to use Creo Parametric 2.0 through IUanyWare, it is so slow that it is nearly impossible to work.""The biggest issue that comes to mind is printing. As an adjunct, it is not very accessible. Students seem to struggle with this except for in computer labs.""The ITS staff are friendly, helpful, and always ready to help me. I really appreciate their hard work. Keep up the good work! "Thank you for what you do!They have been very helpful."Whenever I need help, IT is quick to assist and clear in explanations.""[IRD] works in the UITS office at IUPUC. She, very often, walks around offices and asks individuals if everything is going okay. She's very friendly and kind. I want to say that this is extremely helpful and encourage other UITS offices to consider doing the same.""Free online trainings are greatly appreciated and helpful. Equipment and most services always function as expected. Local campus UITS front-line staff are generally helpful, always quick to respond, and friendly; one UITS staff in particular is especially proactive and caring, which is sometimes abused by others in the dept. Higher level UITS staff are less helpful and friendly than most of the front line support and sometimes seem out of touch with end user issues and perspectives. The campus ""IT Services"" website could be improved to be more helpful for all current and new employees."The process for requesting service by sending a message to techwor"Seem very knowledge; however, not always the most welcoming office on campus."I hate duo."I have never had any troubles with the technology here, but I do know that I can get help from IT if there is trouble. But something that might be helpful to future students is that you could teach them how to use the projectors, because I didn't have a clue how to use them when I got here.""I have only contacted IT for assistance once during my four years at IUPUC. The one time I contacted IT, they were friendly and helpful. As far as using the technology on campus, I am satisfied with computers systems and I really like Canvas, especially the mobile app. I have actually been able to complete assignments on the Canvas app. I also One.IU, but not as much as Onestart. On Onestart, I felt like everything was on one page, so I knew where to find what I needed, but with One.IU I have to find where everything is separately. One.IU is nice, because it has a mobile app and I have been able to register for classes right from the app. I just wish things were a little easier to find on One.IU.""I have only interacted with the UITS staff a few times, and I have found them to helpful and knowledgeable. They helped me with my computer's connectivity issues after upgrading my operating system. They also helped me get my email on my cell phone.""I think I have visited IT twice in my years at IUPUC. Both were positive experiences. They were so helpful- like happy-to-help; any one I spoke with: seemed quite knowledgeable, explained processes until I understood, seemed not at all rushed (I mean, plenty of time to help me), and made me feel comfortable to ask questions. (I had many.)"I have also emailed IT for help 1-3 times. I received prompt responses that were helpful. My latest question was answered thoroughly.I like the remote printing option."Love all the free classes, wish I would've taken note of them sooner.""So far, my experience with UITS services had been great.""The beginning of the current school year had multiple issues with the Wi-Fi, where connections would drop or students were unable to connect at all. This problem was fixed within a week, but it happens every year when the school year starts.""The mobile Canvas app does not work very well. I tried using it for a while, but it is very glitchy. I've noticed that it does not update grades and assignments as quickly as the website does, it may take up to two days before they are loaded onto the app. I've experienced problems with it only showing half of the assignments due at a time as well. It never seemed to work as well or have the full functionality of the website. Other than the problems with the app though, the technology and technology department at school have been extremely helpful."The printers work about 50% of the time. I sometimes suspect this is caused by the way in which you can't print a document until it's uploaded to a website. My question is: Why isn't there a chord connected to the printers so that documents could be printed directly from a personal laptop?

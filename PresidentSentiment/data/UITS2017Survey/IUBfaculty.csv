Most of my time with UITS is about Canvas issues, but not all staff have a good understanding of the platform."Contacting UITS by phone has been really useful on multiple occasions. I really appreciate being able to call them at any time. "I'm not positive what role UITS plays in this, but the annual ballots that are sent to IUB faculty to nominate and vote for BFC members has this problem: One cannot go back to modify one's votes, even when one simply wants to go back and add more nominations/votes rather than to actually change one's existing nominations/votes."I always appreciate quick responses from UITS staff members in a timely manner but it may be more convenient for us if the email can be forwarded to the appropriate department when the question was submitted to a department but should be better accommodated by other department."I am a visiting lecturer, teaching at Indiana University (Bloomington) for just the Spring semester of 2017. During this limited period I have had very limited experience with UITS, but the experience that I have had has been highly satisfying. I have contacted UITS staff on two occasions (had problems with projecting video material in class; a minor technical matter with posting on Canvas); both times staffers were nice and very helpful."I appreciate the availability and access to technical assistance through the knowledge base and call center.I feel as if the service and information I receive from my school-level IT support is significantly better than that received from UITS overall. So my overall ratings may be somewhat biased since I feel UITS suffers by comparison.By far my biggest complaint is the amount of time the Exchange server is inoperable. I literally run my day and manage my tasks using Outlook to such an extent that server downtime is DOWN time for me. Not being able to depend on Outlook is highly problematic."Finally, I find it annoying that in OneIU, when I click on a program icon, I am taken to a description of that program rather than to the program itself. Often the link for where to access/begin the actual program is not obvious, so I'm stuck looking at informational data I don't need to use a program that I cannot find. Once I've accessed a program once, could the system route me directly to it or its login screen rather than to the information page?""I rarely deal directly with UITS, mostly dealing with IT people in the building. My experiences with UITS have been generally positive though.""One thing the survey reminded me of--I find the telephone system very difficult to use. I would like it to be a good deal easier to transfer people, and I'd really like to be able to pick up other phones in my area from my desk phone."I really like UITS. Every time I call they are enormously helpful. One time I called shortly after changing my password and my account froze because my phone had tried to log me on with the wrong password multiple times. Even though it was outside of business hours the young woman was able to help me immediately. I love that I can look information up quickly and find a UITS page devoted to most topics."I wish students would use you more, instead of asking me for help. It's actually really shocking to me how little students know about computers. (I know, I know, ""kids these days."") Students these days seem to know how to point and click and that's it. I told them about computer code/computer programming and many had no idea. It's painful for me to watch a student navigate his/her screen with the mouse instead of using a few simple keyboard shortcuts.""I receive most of my IT support through CITO and have had great service. I have not had any issues with central services such as software downloads, etc. I'm not as enthusiastic about the need to use creative cloud to get some applications and the requirement to establish an adobe account that has to be renewed yearly."It would be helpful to have emergency class services in lecture rooms. Sometimes equipment is broken and only apparent on the day of the lecture. Some sort of phone # etc. in the rooms to call would be helpful."It's imperative that there be better notification of system outages that effect many users (e.g., e-mail, login)."IU mobile print has not been working well since Jan. 2017. I hope the issue can be fixed as soon as possible.I've had only positive experiences so far."My experiences with UITS staff have been extremely positive. I had a team of Techs come to my class during the first week of classes to make sure that the Wi-Fi was strong enough to use TopHat and to help any students who encountered problems logging on. I have also been in contact with the IT training team to arrange instruction for my class on how to use some of the software available through IUWare/IUAnyware. I also received support from UITS in setting up my IU Google calendar with scheduling slots for students to book meetings during my office hours. All of the people I have worked with have been tremendously professional, helpful, and prompt in their efforts.""I have had some issues with IU tech products, though I haven't actually sought help in resolving those problems. I was unable, for example, to get the Citrix receiver to work correctly on either my laptop or my office desktop computer, which means that I have been unable to use IUAnyware. I have also had issues getting my office phone to work properly, and I frequently get voice messages for someone who is not me, but I almost never use that phone, so I've never bothered to try to fix the problems. ""Also, as a qualitative researcher and someone who teaches [IRD], I find it frustrating that there are no qualitative data analysis software programs (Atlas.ti, Nvivo, MAXQDA, etc.) included in IUWare or IUAnyware. This makes it difficult to teach qualitative data analysis, as students are required to purchase their own licenses or use one of the small handful of computers that have this software installed. ""In terms of IU systems, I find one.iu.edu to be somewhat confusing to navigate. The search option is nice, but it seems to work only if you know the precise key words associated with a given application. Also, when multiple options return in the search, it is not always clear which option is the ""correct"" one to choose, and the lack of description with each application icon makes it even harder to judge. Also, the use of ratings stars makes me hesitant sometimes to even open a given application if it gets a very low rating."My interactions lately have been with the help center. I call them about problems that I have with the webserver (webserve) and generally have had nothing but great interactions with the helpful people manning the phones.No concerns or negative feelings."Overall my impressions of UITS are very positive. My only complaint is that it sometimes seems that we switch systems more often than is really necessary. I wonder how much of this is driven by evolving feature sets, with newer systems having features that seem very attractive but in reality are used by very few faculty and staff.""One other problem has to do with Wi-Fi. A couple of years back I switched from Windows to Mac. At the time my Mac would sometimes have difficulty connecting to IU Secure, and I would say that is still a problem. I can understand catering mostly to the Windows/PC environment years ago, but Macs are so prevalent now it seems that there should be no real difference in support across platforms.""People in tech support are friendly, but not always knowledgeable. I found that especially when it comes to Canvas, they are often at sea.""Also, the two-step authentication process is too restrictive. It's too much to require authentication via Duo multiple times *a day*."Canvas is among the most poorly implemented systems I have come across. Please get rid of it along with the people who promoted its adoption."Phone services put us at a disadvantage should the computer be locked and a threat occur. Box has been satisfactory, however the biggest downfall is the terrible lack of organization for shared files. Most faculty have more than 20 shared files which cannot be organized in any meaningful manner."Staff always seem competent and helpful to me. Log in at Griggs seems to take a long time.The UITS staff has always responded to various questions and problems and helped answer questions. They have always been pleasant and never made me feel that my questions were a waste of there time. I do not have anything negative to say about the staff.UITS help staff are very good--whenever I have had questions they have been able to help in a professional and competent manner."UITS products, however, are not so good--the new faculty reporting system that replaces the old FAR is pathetic. Far too many categories for each activity, most of which are either incomprehensible or irrelevant, forcing descriptors that are neither accurate nor comprehensive onto scholarly publications, lectures, and other activities. What a mess. Somewhere I've read that it is hoped that faculty will input their entire resumes and past years' FARs ... dream on.""As for IU secure--blah. I hate using my phone, and never have it where I need it. And carrying around a special jump drive is equally annoying. The result is that I now plan NOT to use smart classroom computers, just to avoid the annoyance. And speaking of which: it takes forever for one of those things to boot up, the touch screens leave students and faculty mystified, and the web browser opens to UITS--which is NEVER what I am looking for and makes it look like the University exists solely so that they can have their toys. Tail wagging the dog.""UITS is always patient, helpful and kind. I couldn't do my job without the help staff. Especially now with Canvas!"I do not like canvas in terms of ease of use or grade entering - even using speed grading - everything is clunky and increases my time spent on grading and entering grades as well as setting up the course each semester. I really dislike it and have been using it for a year before we were required to use it.I need to have access to my student rosters for years with pictures due to students coming back years later for letters of recommendation. Oncourse was used to a point and now I can't see those students pictures or grades so I can't help them by writing a letter of recommendation."Whenever I interact with an UITS staff on phone, it has always been very cordial and helpful. I also find the staff at Information Commons very helpful.""However UITS has plenty of scope to improve their staffing and overall attention to Residential Computer Labs, particularly the one at Evermann Apartments. It is embarrassing that a department that is famed for access, infrastructure and facilities across the campus is treating the residential labs so shabbily. They have the oldest computers, most aged scanner and worst room facility in the housing labs. I can say the same for Campus View. Please do not underestimate the huge number of patrons (and their frustration) that use these facilities.""While I know that some large and major units will need different, more industrial strength CMS systems, I wish that IU provisioned (IU template/branded) WordPress universally for smaller units to use and for individual faculty/researchers to use for personal work sites."Wireless access outside of campus buildings isn't great.

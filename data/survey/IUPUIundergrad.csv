textA. easy way to print from cell phones.Printers aren't always the best.Computers on first floor of LD need to be faster. It takes forever to login .Printer needs to be in SELB building.Add more study rooms on campus or in the library. The first floor could use some if not more. The ability to record a speech needs to be evaluated. Speeches are getting longer and the media files say they are too large. We are permitted to either record or record and upload. The upload is having issues with file size. Please fix this. "Dell computers in the library randomly restart often, and it's annoying when you are in the middle of work or an assignment that you don't know if it was saved or not."Mac mouses are super slow and don't glide as easily as the windows computers.All computers need to have the software necessary. There should not be computers in the ET building that lack programs like Solidworks.All of my experiences have been helpful and positive."All services provided are easily accessible and equally helpful. However, there is a learning gap/curve with a handful of professors using Canvas which is frustrating for students at times."Always good!"As a student employee who has known this campus for over 5 years, I have a good understanding of our technology services, and how they are perceived by incoming students. I think Umail is a wonderful service, and offers everything and more that Box offers. But the userid@umail.iu.edu address is very confusing for new users. Furthermore, Umail's inability to set send-as addresses is frustrating, because I prefer to market my email address as userid@iupui.edu, yet when I send from the Umail interface, it will send or respond with userid@umail.iu.edu. I think this should be technically feasible considering the Umail interface is nearly identical to the widely used Gmail interface and both are developed and provided by Google.""Canvas Duo is such a hassle, especially since I have classes that require all tests to be taken at the testing center. It makes it a lot harder to log into Canvas to take exams, which would be stressful enough by themselves without the added stressor that Duo brings. Also, I don't like that you need to download another app just to access Canvas or financial information. Most of us don't have unlimited phone storage.""Computers on campus take a long while to log into, especially in SL building."Computers will freeze and not save important work.Double side printing on mac computers at the library."DUO is terrible. It makes accessing the testing lab a complete pain and if your phone dies you are unable to access One.IU or Canvas until you have a charge again, meaning if you need to access assignments or emails you can't. It also makes clocking in and out of work stressful if your phone is dead because you can clock in late due to a dead battery and be penalized."Free software.HAVE UITS STAFF SERVICE LOCATIONS AT MULTIPLE PLACES THROUGHOUT CAMPUS! SOME PLACES WHERE THERE ARE COMPUTERS THERE IS NO CELL SERVICE SO YOU CANNOT CALL TO REPORT IT!"Haven't had any interaction with UITS lately. Last semester I had recently reset my passphrase, and when I needed to log in to take an exam I couldn't get in. UITS staff was very helpful and friendly.""Having never taken an on-line class before, I had some trepidation about approaching a class where I'd never meet a classmate, the teachers or the TAs. It was not as harrowing an experience as I expected. Connections have been very dependable. I have no complaints.""I have not interacted much with support, but when I have, I've been able to resolve issues with their help fairly quickly."I am a new student and have just started my art and technology classes. I am so far quite satisfied with the level of service I have been experiencing.I am happy about everything to date and I will definitely let know the faculty members in the future about any inconvenience."I am in [IRD] quite often studying and have observed a couple UITS workers who do an exceptional job at keeping the computer chairs pushed in and the environment clean. However, I would like if all the computers in the ET basement were up to date and each contained the same programs(CREO, Multisim, Microsoft Visual Studios, etc.).""I am not a technologically savvy individual. I don't really know what UITS services provide, but I'm aware that I use them every day (Mon-Fri); using Wi-Fi on my personal device, logging into the campus network, email, etc. As somebody who doesn't really know what I should do if something goes wrong, I'm glad that I've never had to encounter any issues in the time I've been here!""I am really impressed with the motives the UITS take in offering sufficient service to students. The staff I have encountered know what they are doing and they are really polite. For me, I think they are good and they offer a good service to students.""I believe that UITS has done a fabulous job at helping this campus, be an accessible and learning environment. I used Canvas in high school as well, so using it in college is great for me. I do not have to worry about not being able to navigate any assignments, notes or discussions from my classes. ""UITS is also a great help, if I ever need anything done technology wise, such as internet or computer problems, they are a great help. "Thank you! [IRD]I dislike the hours being cut to the 24 hour lab. I frequently use it late into the evening since everywhere else on campus is closed. Since I work and go to school it's the only time I often have to work on homework and I can't do that now.I do not have any problems with UITS staff or services."I do not have very many recommendations for new services, but some improvements that could exist would be personal communication via FaceTime/video source from home if an issue with technology occurred that needs step-by-step guidance that is processed by UITS staff members.""I do not like the Duo two step program to log onto canvas. It complicates things way too much. (Especially at the testing center.) I'm not worried about people getting on my account, so the double log on frustrates me.""I don't frequently use the resources presented by IT on campus, but it is reassuring knowing that if I were to have a problem that there are people willing and ready to help.""I feel that UITS does a fine job however the computers in the IT building lab literally take 5 mins to sign in. Don't believe me, try it yourself. That may not seem like a big deal but it is when you need to get something done. I would either buy new computers with an i7 instead of an i5 or update the system that they run on together but it's ridiculous. Another part of the problem is that you have every program imaginable installed on every computer. Autodesk is huge, all Adobe programs just a little much to me. You could offer specific computers with those functions possibly?""I had an issue with downloading software to my laptop, the UITS guy helped me via chat the best he could. However I still had to wait till the following day to get my software to download"I hate the two step log in.I have dealt only with highly knowledgeable and competent workers throughout the resolution and completing of all of my tech needs at IUPUI.I have had a very satisfactory experience with UITS services. I've been especially pleased with the computer services people in the IT building. If I had any suggestions it would be to perhaps odddffer a basic hardware tutorial session for studentsI have had all positive experiences with UITS and the staff. No recommendations.I would be interested in the focus group if compensation was given to participants."I have had multiple issues negative instances with UITS staff. For example, the printers at the Campus Center were not working. They were flashing a red light. It wouldn't print my paper. I called UITS and the lady said it would take approximately 20 minutes. I needed the paper printed sooner. It wasted 20 of my prints. Also, the printer at the Riverwalk Apartments did not work. There are signs all over that say ""Call UITS for help""... so I called UITS. The guy on the phone could not even recognize what printer I was at. He said it was not a real printer. I wasted another few prints. I have since returned to try again and it did not work.""I have never been able to connect my phone to the IU Wi-Fi and I'm not sure how to, I wish there was sort a tutorial somewhere like on the library page on how to get connected. Also why do the Outlook accounts disable after we graduate, I think students should be informed of this because I tend to use my IUPUI email for most everything since I began here, so it is very inconvenient that I will no longer have access to my email."I have never met anyone from UITS.I have not received any help from them.I have twice printed out big packets and the printer put big black streaks down the center of the pages towards the end of the packets both time.Information on how to print from a personal computer would be helpful."I have visited IT in the Campus Center, the IT bldg., as well as phone contact. Each time, the IT have been extremely helpful with my situation.""I haven't had any interactions with UITS staff in the past year, but all the technology that I've used has been fine. However, the Wi-Fi doesn't usually work as well as I would like.""I haven't had any problems with the people, but some of the computers in the library aren't working.""I haven't had much experience dealing with the UITS staff. Often times in classrooms, however, they were needed to fix a computer. This happened almost daily that a computer wasn't working. Eventually, it got to the point where the classroom was completely full and I couldn't use a computer since about 3 of them were broken. This kept me from doing my homework in there for over 10 minutes. Most of the time the printers work across campus. However, the printer on the bottom floor of the science building is often times breaking down and needing repairs. Only recently have I actually been able to use it. The same goes for the computers in that area. Really slow and login times are very long. In my current physics lab, all of the computers are outdated and very slow. They seem to have been here for multiple years of thorough use."I haven't had the honor to work with UITS yet."I haven't used UITS many times but the times I have, it's been positive. They're very knowledgeable and make sure you understand what they're doing to help you, in terms that you understand."I had a positive experience when I re-enrolled at IUPUI but my name had changed. I needed to get a new student email and the IT staff was very helpful and managed to do it quickly.I love the campus computers and computer labs. I also love the library. The computers are huge and I love being able to have a word document and the internet open on split screen. On campus is my favorite place to study and do homework."I love using the Knowledge Base, so I have had few interactions with UTIS on campus help."I spend the majority of my time in the nursing building and Wi-Fi availability could be better there."I think UITS staff is very good. I had no problems with my experiences with them. When I asked my questions, they were able to help right away. I recommend them to everyone who has questions.""I think the testing center takes away the ability to think during tests. I find that in the testing center I am looking around the room, looking at the staff, and rushing through my test. I think there should be an option to sit in a room by yourself or have the ability to write your tests.""I think there should be more times offered for the IT Training classes. I could not participate in some classes which I really wanted to take, because I had my regular classes to attend at that time."I wanted to scan a document and needed help. The equipment prompts were not helpful so went to a help desk and the person had no idea how to scan a document. WHAT? How can an employee not know or have access to a tutorial to assist in helping me. He was useless and I had to get help from someone not associated with the UITS department. Silly right?I wish it was bigger and had more people working.I wish the Wi-Fi was better during peak times. I also would like there to be access to the Adobe Cloud software for free."I work with them a lot, they are always helpful.""I would recommend having more work stations with 2 monitors. As an engineering student I have lots of reference material, eBooks, and googling to do while I am working on a project. I could work much more efficiently without switching between different windows all of the time. I would also recommend putting, solid works, autocad, and ANSYS available on IU anyware."Improve Canvas."In some of the IUPUI buildings, internet does not work very well. It makes wasting our time by waiting for the time to speeding up of it. Thanks.""In the beginning of the year, I was having trouble turning in assignments through Microsoft Edge. I went to the desk at the campus center, and was helped immediately. The man helped me find what the issue was, then helped me download a different browser to use. It was very quick and efficient service.""In the student self service center, the class search is not at all intuitive. I struggle with it every time I am trying to find a class even if I know the course number."It would be helpful if one.iu.edu could be offered as a phone app as well to make certain functionalities available/easier to use on the phone."Canvas is great for class organization! Along with one.iu it's my favorite school interface thing I've had access to so far. However the recent crashes have made taking tests, turning in assignments, and studying difficult. Considering classes rely so heavily upon canvas, if it doesn't work it can feel like our education or the class has to stand still until the issue is fixed. ""Printing has been a big issue this semester. Many wireless printers (in the library especially) have printed empty pages, lines instead of words, or just do not print at all. This interfered with being prepared for classes. It was also upsetting considering we are required to pay a set amount of money in order to use these printers each semester. I expect IUPUI to offer functioning services if I'm being expected to pay for those services."IUPUI ET building needs new lab computers."I've only ever had a few experiences with UITS. The first was trying to figure out what computers on campus had the software Maple. The first person I went to, who was in the basement of ET, didn't really tell me where to go so I went to check IT and saw another person there and directed me to the computers in the SL/LD lobby. The second time was online, trying to figure out how get the Citrix receiver to work. The person I was chatting with helped me through the entire process as well as sending me the knowledge base page to deal with the people."I've used the main computer lab before and found the noise of others talking and playing music very annoying.Laptops in psychology lab rooms are old and slow and sometimes do not work.My main concern is the ability of the IU Secure Wi-Fi access points and if they can actually handle so many devices at once.My only experience with UITS is through the web. The One portal and with Canvas for online courses. I've been generally pleased with the One portal and related apps. The Canvas system appears to be good for distributed learning for the most part. But I've been disappointed with the quality/age of the videos and the technology to play them.The lecture videos for the [IRD] class appear to be 7-10 years old or more. I realize this is a class specific issue but it reflects on the overall technological perception of IU.I really wish the video player technology would remember where you left off on a particular video between sessions and devices. It's very frustrating to watch part of a lecture and then have to scroll/scan through the lecture to a certain time when returning to it later and/or on a different device.My personal laptop will not connect to IU SECURE Network and I have to use the AT&T Wi-Fi and it was an inconvenience but that was about the only thing that I had an issue with.N/ANo comment."No issues, they always help me with my tech problems."No recommendations."No, I do not have any issues."NoneNone."Once, I was unable to figure out why two different videos on canvas were pulling up the same feed, and a UITS staff was able to view my screen and figure out the issue. One thing that can be frustrating at times, is how I am unable to connect to the WIFI to do homework assignments. Sometimes its in the middle of the day, others its at night. I know technology can have glitches, but it can be frustrating when I am trying to accomplish tasks."Overall good experiences. Have experienced dead zones of Wi-Fi services within numerous building on the IUPUI campus. Most notability IT. I'd recommend preforming some form of signal integrity evaluation of coverage within buildings."One.iu is much better than OneStart, however I think the number of ""apps"" could be reduced or at least clustered/categorized to reduce clutter and make it easier to find the service you are looking for without having to search for it. ""Canvas is better than OnCourse, but I think the messaging service should be more integrated within the courses.""Overall interaction with any UITS staff has been helpful. Availability of screen recording software for us to use would be ideal (like the instructors use), or training for all of them to know how to use it. I just had to purchase a subscription to Screencastify (a plug-in for Chrome) to record screen and audio.""Overall, my experience has been positive. For the most part, staff has been available to come quickly when I have a problem with the printer or computer on campus. I'm super impressed with the wireless charging in the IT building in the computer lab. I would love to see some of that in buildings closer to the center of campus, because I am a liberal arts student and I don't have any classes in that building.""Please get rid of the two-step login. It is annoying and unnecessary. I understand that I need it to access my employment information through Indiana University, but I feel my password is more than long enough to make me feel secure.""Provide more cleaning products to clean off desks, keyboards, monitors in labs. Not all labs are cleaned (appropriately or at all) by staff. [ex: library is very dirty, but I do not think UITS is involved in sanitizing library computers.]""Since attending IUPUI in the Fall of 2015, I have not had any issues with UITS staff or services. Any problems that I may have encountered have been professionally addressed and rectified by UITS staff personnel. They have taken the time to listen to my concerns and have appropriately helped me in overcoming any problems in a timely manner."Some computers like the ones in the Print Shop at Herron are incredibly slow. Often they take over 10 minutes to open up."Staff are always helpful and nice. Although, sometimes they are a bit loud (especially in the IT building lab on the first floor) which can be distracting. It is also unfair because students get told to lower their voices, yet the staff is often loud.""The computers on campus take a long time to logon to, it would be nice if they were faster.""The Duo process seems good and ideal to protect our information, but whenever my phone is down, or I do not have internet, or my phone is simply not with me, how am I supposed to get access to my canvas?"The employees are typically quite nice.The internet access still needs to be improved.The printing system on personal MacBook still didn't work. Makes it difficult sometime.The internet in University Tower is horrible. It is super slow and is always crashing. Also when I try to log into Xfinity on Campus it always says that I am not connected to campus internet.The IT system that IUPUI uses seems quite well put together and user-friendly. I have yet to have to use any more than some very basic functions though. The one thing that could use some major improvement would be a password secured Wi-Fi that is thoroughly supported and boosted across campus allowing greater usage of personal devices."The new unified printer driver system is hit and miss, especially in the ET building. Also, IU Secure packet throttling is a bit heavy-handed."The search engine for classes within one.iu.edu for registering classes is horrible. That has been my only problem when it comes to technology at IUPUI. There should be a better way to search for classes with specific key terms just like on any search engine. My searches were always too broad or too specific so finding courses was a pain and took longer than it should have. I ended up using the websites of various schools to find out what courses they offered and generally when and from there checked the class search engine for specific times and teachers."The self service center needs to be mobile friendly. I do pretty much everything on my phone. I am constantly out running errands etc. and busting out a 15"" laptop every time I want to browse class offerings or check on my registration to do's etc. is not practical. I wish I could use igps and self service on my phone. Sometimes it works, sometimes its impossible. ""Umail is frustrating because there is no way to connect it to my phone email either. I cannot receive emails through my phone email or view it easily or quickly through iu mobile. IU mobile I can at least access it, but it's a 3 or 4 step process. ""I did set up my umail to forward everything to my private school only email address, but it hasn't worked so far."The staff had been great. I did have some trouble using my jagtag to access the lab. Not too sure why? user name [IRD]"The UITS staff is fantastic. Their response time and expertise have gotten me out of some technological conundrums as well as helped me purchase and encrypt hardware for our overseas sites. As for services, the electronic fax system is very efficient and definitely takes the hassle out of the faxing process.""The wireless network can get bogged down sometimes, and some of the computers in the ET building have really slow loading times occasionally."There are a moderate amount of Wi-Fi dead zones in lots of buildings.There should be at least one printer that is easily accessible in every building or on every floor.They are all very helpful."They are so very helpful!! Every time I've come to them with a problem or called them, they have been there to solve the problem. Very reliable!"They were very helpful connecting with iusecure."Though it has been only once, the experience I had with the UITS staff and services was positive. I had several questions in regards to the IUware and all of my questions were resolved quickly by their services.""To be honest, I haven't had any interactions with UITS staff."UITS helped me download Creative Cloud and helped me work through the issues I ran into while installing said program. The employee was very helpful and gave me good pointers and instructions.UITS services has been great.UITS staff are typically very quick to respond to technology issues I have and come to my office to help the same day or the next. I also think it is easy to submit a tech request.UITS staff I have come in contact with have always been helpful and fixed my problems. I appreciate that most of them do not do the 'hand holding' which means they make the patron do the steps themselves so the patron can learn how to use a system or fix the problem if it happens again."UITS staff is great - always friendly and helpful. IU Secure, as a network, is terrible sometimes. I will be in the middle of campus and just get kicked off the network. This is especially troublesome when I'm trying to complete assignments for my online classes.""UITS staffs are very helpful and friendly. My only concern is the scan machine. I had some trouble using it to scan a book, but no very few librarians are able to help me solve the problem."University Tower's printed in their computer lab has been down all year long. Please get this back!"Well sometimes when some electronic appliance does not work, I have informed UITS staff to take look at it and their usual response is that they will check it out later. And the next day it is still the same, nothing is fixed. I don't know whether they have taken a look at it or not. It might be that they don't know how to fix it, but this is one thing I am concern about.""When I had to get my Duo token because my phone was acting up, the staff at the campus center and IT were very helpful in getting me what I needed and how to get it.""When the campus first started using two-step login, I didn't have my token with me and didn't have my DUO Mobile set up in my phone. I called UITS at 10pm and had really good service. The agent was very helpful and patient, and my problem was solved in 15 minutes.""While it is understandable if it is not currently feasible, please consider adding support for the steam link. Also, some parts of some campus buildings do not get sufficient connections to IU secure. Consider using Wi-Fi extenders like in the dorm rooms. It makes a huge difference and they are relatively cheap.""While using a University Library computer, I was IM'ing one of the UITS helpdesk staff. There were minutes between replies. I hope to not sound picky as it could have been the connection."WHY IS THE 24 HOUR LAB SO FREEZING COLD ALL THE TIME?I ACTUALLY HAVE TO STOP AND GO OUT TO MY CAR AND WARM UP AND THAT IS VERY TIME CONSUMING. I USE UR LAB BECAUSE I HAVE TO NOT BECAUSE I WANT TO. I JUST DONT UNDERSTAND WHY YOU PEOPLE NEED IT FREEZING COLD IN THERE YEAR ROUND."With the addition of streaming TV instead of cable, Wi-Fi has been slower."You are doing a great job."I understand there can be problems with my older computer, but I wish the Wi-Fi connection could be strong and consistent throughout the entire library. There are occasional dead spots or areas where it might occasionally be harder to connect with IU secure (especially on the third floor)."

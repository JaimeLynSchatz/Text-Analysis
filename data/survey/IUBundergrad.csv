When I was working on an assignment due at midnight that night, the computer unexpectedly went into sleep mode and would not come out of it. It was 9:00 p.m. and I called UITS for help. They tried telling me a couple of things that I could do, all of which I tried with no success. That was understandable. However, they then told me there was nothing they could do to help me. I was very dissatisfied with the lack of care or information that I was given about how to further solve the problem."Absolutely dislike the two step login."Assistants at the UITS help desk at Wells are generally prompt and prepared. There could be improvement with wait-times and appointment sign-ups to increase efficiency. DUO has some problem-areas - it is recommended that DUO two-step authentication not be applied to all applications requiring IU login (for instance, applications that allow someone to report a stolen or lost ID should be able to bypass DUO authentication, as phones are often stolen at the same time as IDs, which means that individuals can't readily report their cards stolen)."Better Wi-Fi Connections.Warnings to system shut downs.Canvas sucks."Clarifying downloading and using Microsoft Office for Mac, how to report phishing incidents."Computers are slow.Duo is possibly the worst idea anyone has come up with at IU in recent memory. The perfect way to mess up already busy students' lives."Easier ways to get Photoshop on computers, easy directions."Every time I have gone to UITS they usually cannot help me with the problem I have.Every time I try to print something off of my computer the server is not working or the printers wont print/work. When I ask for help over something as simple as printing I get redirected and have to wait because only one or two people can fix the problem. It is frustrating every time I need to print something it takes me at least an hour or more when it should only take a few minutes at most."Everything I have experienced thus far with UITS has been an immense pleasure due to the fact that an answer is always found for my problem, whether that be a direct response or possibly an alternative solution that still answers my problem."Everything is good but the only thing that I want to feedback is the thing that when I try to modify my search I need to re-fill out all blank to search.Extremely difficult to print. Has been an issue since after Winter Break. Takes a half hour to print something. Big issue."Hello,""I've only had a handful of experiences with UITS and they seem fairly pleasant. My only real issue I have is with IU Secure. The connection always seems to drop out or load very slow. Not sure if there is anything to be done, but that would be my only complaint.""I am dissatisfied with the quality of desktops in the SPEA/Business information commons. I use desktops frequently on campus, and these are the worst. They take long to log into. They also have many minor functionality issues that drive me nuts. I use Visio for many of my classes; creating objects and dragging them into the correct place never works... the mouse does not respond like you would expect. ""However, I am very satisfied with many other IT moments I have with IU including: internet speed, IU anyware software offerings, Canvas education management SaaS, other computer labs. Overall, well done!""I am happy with the UITS services. I have spoken with the staff members in the computer lab in the IMU multiple times and they have always been friendly and helpful. However, I find some of the online information difficult to navigate. For example, my club has a web account through IU and I had to get the password reset, and it was difficult to find information about how to do that. I also find the Student Center class registration system very annoying. It's like there are different places to search for courses versus adding them to your cart so you have to try to remember the course number to add it to the shopping cart, but sometimes that doesn't work either. It's also very annoying to have to keep entering the same search info over and over again ""undergraduate :: Bloomington :: spring 2017 :: department"" etc. I wish the search function was more like the other course browser app on one.iu.edu. Also, with the umail accounts, I have trouble accessing other google products, like YouTube. It would be nice if they functioned as full google accounts.""I am thoroughly pleased with the UITS staff here on campus. Unfortunately, I haven't had a lot of contact with them, but last Saturday I went in to get my computer fixed. I was helped immediately and the man attending to my computer was very helpful and knowledgeable. He answered all the questions I had for him, upgraded my operating system for free, and even downloaded all of the essential applications I needed after I got my hard drive wiped. It took about 30 minutes and it was well worth it.""I am very satisfied with the experiences I have had when I have gone to the help center at Wells Library. The people who helped me were very friendly and dedicated to getting my problem resolved. However, I have not been very satisfied with IU Secure because it isn't always reliable. Also, I have been very dissatisfied with the printing system on campus. Nearly every time I print something, uploading it online to the Print Center doesn't work and I need to log in to the campus computers in my dorm which are very slow.""I believe there needs to be some updating with the computers in the West Tower of Wells Library, particularly in the 5th floor. The computers are slow, making it inconvenient to work in that area."I can say that all experiences I've had with UITS staff members have been professional and beneficial. The online chat service is awesome and very convenient."I didn't interact much with UITS employees this year. The few times I did in the library, they were able to help me out."I don't have a lot of experience with UITS staff. I think most of IUs programs run fine for me and I haven't ever had a major problem with them. I did ask how to setup a streaming device in my dorm room and UITS staff was very helpful and I got it setup quick. They took time to look up information and answered me in a timely manner. Sometimes IU secure is down or a little slow but UITS does a good job of getting it running again.I feel like the student center needs a new look. It's format seems kind of outdated and it could definitely use a makeover.I had troubles connecting my devices to the Wi-Fi and they are always helpful getting my certificates. I don't have anything negative to say about UITS."I hate the duo log in process. I've heard nothing but complaints about it from students. It makes checking your email or canvas twice as difficult and takes twice the amount of time. I do not understand, as a student, why I had to change to the duo log in. If I forget my phone or have it in a different room, or its dead, etc. I can't check my grades or even get into my account. This is annoying and more difficult then it needs to be."I have attended a training on CSS & HTML."I have been most successful when talking to UITS staff in person or over the phone. Sometimes working with technology requires restarts and then I lose the UITS chat, plus talking with someone can make fixing my computer less stressful.""IU secure can be unpredictable, especially in older buildings on campus""I have really only visited UITS once or twice, but this year, it was crucial. Essentially, my laptop had downloaded some Windows update incorrectly and would not boot. After 5-6 hours with UITS across 2 days, we were able to get my files off before deleting my hard drive and ultimately reinstalling the OS. My computer works great now, and I haven't had any issues since August. Great job!""I'd very much like to see the redesign/decommissioning of the Student Self Service portal; it's always been difficult to navigate, and now looks old and non-user friendly."I'd also like to see more kinds of software come to IUWare.I haven't used UITS except for getting help on how to use the scanners at the IMU. The guy that helped me was very informative in explaining what I needed to do."I just have one thing to say that is about a printer (it might not be about UITS though). I often use a printer, but it often has problems, so I cannot print out what I need.""I like how the UITS works. Whenever I go to UITS service at the Wells library, I always am satisfied with visiting even though the waiting line is long.""I love IU, the star as well as the students. I'm happy that I decided to further my career here at IU."I love the KB!I hate how IU email accounts are distributed. Having exchange & umail & indiana.edu has been a nightmare for me.DUO authentication rollout should have been more aggressive about giving out the handheld token generators."I personally don't like duo. I appreciate the attempt at adding security to log ins, but it's extremely inconvenient if I'm trying to log on and my phone is dead or trying to clock in at work within a timely manner.""I rarely have issues that I need to report to UITS, but whenever I do run into them, I have positive experiences with UITS. I feel like they do a great job keeping the systems up and the duo process log in is a good move.""I really dislike the duo two step system. I understand that it is to ensure extra safety for our information, but it's really inconvenient. Sometimes, my cellphone dies and I don't have access to canvas after that, or sometimes I might forget my phone at home, and make it all the way to SPEA, which is a 45 minute walk from my house, and not be able to access my email, class information, or any other IU information I might need. Even if there is a two step system, I feel there is a huge need for revision to be able to access IU services without a phone."I rely on them.I think the UITS staff are great at responding to problems.I think the Wi-Fi has been improved and now it's available throughout the campus although sometimes it's either weak or unavailable outdoors. Improve on that will be my first suggestion."I think UITS has a lot of helpful services and the website is full of useful information. There's actually so much information it would be helpful to have a page that briefly outlines UITS's in-person services and online info based on activity (e.g. print from your computer, using box, other services IU offers, improve your knowledge of your PC, etc.).""I think UITS should be more open to students. I noticed that there are a lot of useful applications on one.iu, but there is still room for improvements."I would like stronger Wi-Fi signals across campus. It would be nice to work on my laptop in the arboretum."In general, I find that UITS hierarchy of solving issues takes too long and things occasionally end up more complicated than necessary to solve simple problems. I think UITS sends too many emails about things that are vaguely useful or only useful for a small population. I also have noticed an increase rather than a decrease in the number of phishing emails since duo. Additionally, relating to the retirement of some of the programs, I believe it took far too long and that deadlines were pushed back several times instead of having a hard line when people needed to adopt new technology which caused frustration when taking classes that instructors were allowed to use different technology to post grades and assignments.""In regards to Duo Login, that definitely is quite frustrating. I understand the need for Duo to be used for student financial reasons, and for faculty, but I find it highly unnecessary for students to deal with. Especially in this day and age, things happen to our phones easily. Therefore, that can make it nearly impossible to access our accounts."It is great! They are very welcoming and attentive to new customers.Is there a way to make the adobe connect classes more accessible on other browsers?"It is kind of embarrassing because you have to take many steps, but it is nice that personal privacy improved."IT services have helped me boot camp my computer and help with wireless connection issues I have."IT has not been helpful with me bypassing the 2 step login since I am studying abroad and can't access my IU accounts. IU IT services are not being helpful in connecting me to a supervisor who can help me with my issue and is instead asking me the same questions if I can call in my problem, and as I've explained, I cannot due to not being in the country.""It's absolutely ridiculous that the GetConnected application is required to connect to IU Secure. It's a Wi-Fi network. Use a captive portal or something, but don't make me install some random software to which I then need to give admin access just so I can get on the damn Wi-Fi. It's spyware, and needlessly complex.""I wish there was a web portal for printing - I installed the application for printing from a personal computer a year or two ago, and it worked for a short time, but then failed completely. A web portal where documents could be uploaded (maybe you could integrate it with Box?) and sent to the print queue automatically seems relatively simple to develop, and would free up the computers around the busiest printers (such as in Kelly) where lines form so people can log on, open their file, print it, then log off, because it's such a pain to print directly from a personal computer.""One.IU.edu is a great website - why is Student Center so bad? It's barely usable, ugly, unintuitive, and obfuscated to the point of absurdity. You've gotten rid of OnCourse and OneStart; those were good moves, but why is the worst piece of software with which students interact still here? One.IU implemented a review system - how about you read some of the reviews for Student Center? https://one.iu.edu/task/iu/student-center""I know people don't like Duo, but I commend UITS for mandating MFA - great move.""I think it's been more than a year since this change happened, but the unlimited storage on Box is great. Unfortunately, I don't think many people know about it. Same thing with iGPS - great software (although I wish it still had the ""build schedule"" feature) that nobody knows about.""IU Secure Wi-Fi is very difficult to stay connected to, especially in the Public Health Building. Some instructions on the website are difficult to navigate- still can not figure out how to connect my kindle to IU Secure, for some reason there is a different procedure.""I've been having a lot of trouble with the print services since the beginning of the semester, especially in Jordan Hall and the School of Public Health.""Additionally, it is impossible to get Wi-Fi in some classrooms. This is kind of ridiculous to me. In about 3/4 of Jordan Hall the Wi-Fi is terrible. Simon Hall also has some issues, but not as bad as those in Jordan. It makes it really difficult to do some internet-based assignments in class.""I've had a terrible experience with UITS. Last year I had my school email hacked and every time I would go to get help they wouldn't be able to. However, they would give me a name and number of someone who was supposed to help me. From there that person would refer me back to UITS and it was a 4 month long process where the police had to get involved."I've had only good experiences."I've had very limited interactions with the UITS Staff, but they've all left me with decent impressions. The most useful and positive experience I had was with the online-chatting system. The respondents were fast, kind, and were able to solve all of my problems every time. This is a feature that is still very important to me and should be emphasized to those looking for help but are also busy and may not always be able to come in person to have their problem reviewed. Sometimes there have been hardware problems in lab locations with various computers, but otherwise there aren't too many noticeable problems I experience daily."I've never used the assistance of a UITS staff member.I've only had positive experiences with UITS staff. They were very friendly and able to properly diagnose my technological issue in a timely manner. I wouldn't change a thing."I've used UITS multiple times for computer questions. I've used them at Wells, McNutt, the union, and on the chat and phone features. I've always has positive experiences and they've always been helpful to the extend that they can be."Make an easier way to connect personal laptops to available printers."Mobile printing is one of the most inconvenient services offered. I am a sophomore and I have a lot to print from home but once I come to campus and try to print, it deletes my print order from the documents lists, and I have been in jeopardy several times because of this. Hope you could improve this service."My issue with my login was fixed in a timely manner.N/ANoNo comment.No problems with UITS staff or services."Overall, I am satisfied with our technology services, although there can be issues such as periodical crashing.""Overall, I have had generally positive experiences with UITS and its services. I'd also like to compliment UITS on the ONE IU search function, as I believe it was a really useful way to present everything.""Overall, it is great. I wish the IU secure could be more stable.""Please find a way to make HUE lights work on the network. Also, UITS is notoriously condescending and rude. Information gets through, but people are often not willing to talk to UITS because of the way they respond to people.""PLEASE get rid of Duo. It is awful and a gigantic pain. Plus, it isn't even on my phone so it isn't enhancing security all that much. All it does is infuriate people and make it so that we would get locked out of our systems if we forgot anything. I am a full time student as well as an employee and it is awkward having to use a device to log in to Canvas during class hours.""I am graduating this semester so there isn't really much benefit in contacting me and Duo will no longer be impacting me, but I figured I could add my voice to those of others."Please improve the student center!Printers are often out of ink."Setting up printing from a laptop is slightly tricky, and I would love to see a list of where all campus printers are. Usually UITS is very helpful and refills paper or fixes jams fairly quickly."Some printers in the library or Kelley don't work well.Sometimes IU Secure randomly disconnects even if I remain in the same place."The actual staff are quite nice; however, OneStart is still absolutely awful."The best thing about anything involving technology on this campus is that it just works! I think the IT team is always working hard to be knowledgeable and I have yet to have a question that couldn't be answered by UITS staff."The customer service is really great, keep doing what you're doing there. My one issue, however, is that remote printing is a pain. Apparently, there's an app for my computer I can get but I can't find the information on that on the UITS website and the remote printing website rarely works.""The live chat help is useful and most UITS staff are pretty knowledgeable. But many of the hardware and software programs provided are unreliable, namely those used through the Citrix receiver. Software and hardware issues often go unresolved. 2 of my 3 business classes this semester have had changes in the course due to technological limitations that haven't been fixed, despite being halfway through the semester. Many computers are also slow and outdated in Well's library and Kelley computer labs."The main concern I have is giving incoming students information on how to fix any simple problems themselves. And info about network cords.The mobile print function/website needs to be majorly overhauled. It works incredibly inconsistently when no-hassle printing is a very basic and very necessary need of students.The one area that I feel we fall short is with our print servers. 50%+ of the time documents I print never make it to the print station."The only negative interaction I've had with the technology here has been the computer labs in Eigenmann. Even though they work efficiently, the time for the computers to log into your account takes a good amount of time. Other than that, they have been reliable.""The only thing I could recommend is a better way for students to report service outages. I've worked on IT before, and I know when a printer is no longer connected to the IU print system. I'd like to be able to report that without emailing or calling."The printers in the residence halls never seem to be working and take forever to get fixed."The printing is extremely slow in the SPEA/Kelley area. The computers take forever to log on, and sometimes it doesn't even get sent to the printer.""Also, I tried to get my laptop hooked up to the printing and I was told some laptops would never connect to the network. I wish the service worked with all computers because I have a relatively new HP and was denied."The printing system needs to be fixed ASAP. Mobile.Print has not been working this semester."The recital scheduling program for music students still uses internet explorer or Firefox. It could use an overhaul and an update for a better browser, i.e. Chrome. "#NAME?The service is great and they are always there and willing to help.The staff provide such excellent service that their pay should be higher."The Wi-Fi ""IU Secure"" did not work all year!!!!! I'm so angry about that. Also, I made many appointments with UITS - someone had come here, but nobody fixed it."The Wi-Fi is terrible. It never seems to work and is extremely slow. The printers also seem to be broken all the time. Also canvas seems to not work most of the time.The Wi-Fi within the dorms really needs improved. On the weekends and Friday nights the Wi-Fi especially in Forest get so bogged down it is useless.They serve me the best and treat me nicely. Guide me very well for the problems that I had. Never had any negative experience with the service."This year, printing has been an issue for me. Trying to find a computer on campus can sometimes be difficult, so it would be helpful if the IU mobile print website worked better."UITS are very knowledgeable people. In the beginning of the semester I got a virus and they were able to get rid of the virus and tell me about the services IU provides for security software. I think it would be helpful to have UITS people in the residence halls because it would be more efficient for the residents instead of having to go to the IMU or Wells."UITS has been overall helpful, with a few minor things here and there. Nothing major to report.""UITS has provided me a lot of very useful services that I use daily. These include software (especially Adobe programs like Photoshop), Box, Canvas, One.iu, and Umail. These run very well and have positively contributed to my learning."UITS is a very helpful resource IU has to offer.UITS provides excellent support each time I visit them. I would try to get a new printer for the Eigenmann computer lab.Very helpful."When my computer had a virus last year, UITS was able to fix it very quickly and efficiently."Wi-Fi needs to be stronger throughout campus."Your techs are great. They're kind, helpful, and want to get the job done. I've had less luck, however, in a few other areas.""I guess I'm not a fan that I am forced to use two-step login even though I'm not a professor or student employee. I'm just a student guys. My friends don't need their phones to log in to Canvas, but I do.""I guess I'm also not a fan of the fact that computers all across campus often take five minutes or more to log in, causing lines to form of people waiting, hoping to be able to print their documents before class. This backup results in dozens of people either giving up (and thus not printing class slides, etc.) or sticking it out and being forced to go to class late because the computers logged in too slowly.""The computers in Union Street Center take about ten seconds to log in. Why do the ones in the Kelley School of Business (and elsewhere) need five minutes? That means that, realistically, there is only time for two people to use each computer in gaps between classes. That's embarrassingly inefficient.""I guess you could say I'm also not a fan of the wired internet slowdown that took place in my residence hall in summer 2016. These ""Aruba"" boxes you installed over the Ethernet ports reduced wired internet speeds by over 400 mbps. You wasted your time and money on a project to make our internet WORSE here. Residents weren't particularly happy.""Further, it didn't help that the Aruba boxes weren't even installed correctly initially, so I (and others) had to wait for weeks for my Aruba box to be fixed. Well, you did send a friendly tech within days to *confirm* that it was broken. The tech was genuinely nice, and confirmed that UITS had broken the port over the summer (shocking, considering it had worked when I lived in the same room the year before) but he wasn't authorized to fix it for weeks because of a network freeze. Great job, management. Truly inspirational.""Then, as I mentioned, after it was fixed, I was horrified to discover that my internet speeds had taken a nosedive from the past year — but the techs were forced to kindly tell me there was nothing they could do because my mbps wasn't quite a single-digit number. Apparently 10 mbps is good enough for ""academic"" uses, according to UITS policy, so it can't be looked at.""This policy is horrifying, and ignores the struggles of college students. Netflix (which I don't have, personally) and other such services require reasonably high internet speeds, and these are how thousands of students cope with the stresses of exams and relationships, and briefly escape from it all. Every IU organization besides UITS emphasizes the importance of taking breaks and not stressing over day-to-day life, including by using such online services. That UITS management established a policy that directly contradicts this is demeaning and definitely worthy of investigation.""UITS is an embarrassment to Indiana University. You have great techs, but for whatever reason management handcuffs them and prevents them from actually solving problems. Management's decision-making with installing the Aruba boxes was sickening. UITS policies are laughable compared to other tech services."Or at least they would be laughable if they didn't hurt people.

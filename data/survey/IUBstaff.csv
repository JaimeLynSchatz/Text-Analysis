textI no longer receive info about the number of pages left on my printing quota; this was very helpful & I wish this service had not been discontinued."Come to think of it, I have not received an e-newsletter from UITS recently either. Why was this discontinued?""First floor Wells UITS staff service has improved greatly, but it is still uneven. Staff members should never tell patrons ""I don't know,"" but instead should try to find out something or point patrons in the direction of someone who does know. They should wear name badges to be held accountable."Overall campus computer centers could be MUCH cleaner please.School of Education library computers are a mess now that [IRD] (dedicated staff) are gone. They're always down. Please bring the service back to the level it was when the two of them were at IU!I work on all campuses - Kokomo library computers are great and so is the helpdesk!The helpdesk at the IMU is great too - often not staffed enough.My desktop PC's at IUPUI shuts down often during high winds/bad weather.Would love to see ONE video conferencing system. Seems like no two rooms have the same set up. * Video connectivity is with our team of 20 is VERY frustrating. UITS protocol for communicating breaches has come a long way in the right direction over the past 5 years - Way to go!!!All my calls for IT support have been positive. The staff on the line helped me trouble shoot and helped me solve whatever issue I called to fix. I've really appreciated this assistance.All of my experiences with the Executive IT Services staff at the CIB and in Bryan Hall have been wonderful.All of my experiences with UITS have been very positive. I work with both the Exec IT group and HelpNet and have truly enjoyed working with them.Answers within a day.Appreciate the efforts of UITS [IRD] and his staff to help VPCPF with setting our staff up for the duo authentication.Are there live demos of the technology that we have access to with Q & A sessions? This would be great to see more of in newsletters from UITS and other communications so we know where and when to attend. Even remote demos would be advantageous for all users."As a general comment, I greatly appreciate working in this environment. The changes in tech seem more rapid than usual and I believe due to security threats. I've noticed co-workers struggling to keep up - I direct to knowledge base when I lack answers and always see it as the first line of information."As a risk manager I have to say that the phone system that requires you to be logged on and active to have phone connection constitutes a very high risk in the event of a disaster. This is especially dangerous in the case of work place violence or an active shooter. I feel that at the very minimum all front office staff and areas that can be used as 'safe' rooms should have hardwired phones."As an internal user of a wide array of UITS services, I can say that overall there are many caring, useful people representing UITS. My issues are usually situations where cross communication internal to UITS is not the best - too many silos."Many of these questions applied to services I didn't know were available to me (i.e. training)."At times the computer support staff in my building (IMU) are over-worked, and I think under-staffed.""Before I read this survey, I received no communication at all that OneStart would be decommissioned, so that was a surprise. When will the change take place? Why the change? What is the replacement to be? How to learn of these changes that I don't receive?""Appreciate the DUO system, although it wasn't explained (and I'm still unsure?) when I will be texted to use it and when I won't. What's the criteria? If it pops up, I ""duo.""""I asked the consultant on the telephone how to set an appointment to meet in person with a consultant in Wells Library - Bloomington. I was told ""they're always in."" I asked again that I wanted to set an appointment for Canvas help. Again, I was told no appointment as ""they're always here."" After I went across campus at 9:30 AM and chunked money in the library parking meter on a weekday, I learned that they ""are not always in."" Give your telephone people a resource as an option that they can set an appointment for a caller at the time that the solution is beyond the telephone consultant's ability to resolve the problem.""Better replacement cycle for computers in STC labs, some of the hardware is old and running very slow with Windows 10. "Should probably rethink the durability of the Ricoh printers. The one closest to where I work is always breaking down. Don't know that they are made to withstand the amount of constant use."Printing is difficult to understand, especially when printing from a laptop. "KB could be clearer for a user when trying to set up their laptop for the very first time too. (I've tried to help people with it)"Don't think the thin clients were a good investment, should rethink that and probably not do it again."I work in a library that partners with UITS and ended up having to have the thin clients removed from our space because they couldn't get them to recognize our library print queues. What a disaster that whole thing was for us."I do have to say that the STC folks who fix issues are prompt, reliable & great at their jobs. Kudos to them.""We changed out our analog phone this year and I am thankful to the Unicom ladies who walked me through the process of setting up our group account and getting our voice mail set up . They were patient, kind and willing to help."Kudos to the consultant who helped me with DUO after I had changed phones. It's working great for me."Bryan Hall EITS guys are the best. Always helpful, knowledgeable, and provide very pleasant service."Calls to UITS have been positive. People seem to go out of their way to get the answer if they do not know it right away. The students who work in the Library support center are wonderful. I always get my problems solved.Phone- which you could increase the sound; the head sets do no hold their charge well.I put no for focus group because I am not very tech savvy- if you need someone like that I would help."I would like to see repeat classes, as with a work schedule you can not always take the time away- and then you have to wait a long time- I do realize you are busy- just wanted you to know I like the classes when I can fit one in."EITS supports our office and does a very nice job."Every interaction I have with any of the people from UITS is great. Your people are so polite and professional. I have said it before and I will keep on saying it, the people in your office are amazing and patient.""Every time I've called I've had a positive experience. That said, working with towers vs a laptop /docking station model has been a big change for me personally - not necessarily a bad thing to not bring work home, but also not quite as flexible as I've been used to in corporate.""File storage solutions are not very well ""advertised"". Besides departmental servers, I really don't know how to store/share files. ""The ""monitor"" seems to be more for techies and students rather than general staff/faculty users. More tips and tricks regarding phone services/Skype/general storage solutions/iuware apps/mobile computing with tablets would be interesting & helpful.""Folks are generally pleasant, efficient, and able to solve the problem no matter what you ask them or when. Extended hours are appreciated. Walk in service is great when you need to show them what your machine is doing. Liked having folks come out to various sites on campus to help get Duo added and up and running. Love the free token backup login option for Duo systems.""Kuali is ornery to deal with and logging in hours worked is time consuming and cumbersome. Software is not user friendly and not well explained. SIS is difficult to use. Searching for classes requires many steps and these frequently have to be redone if you want to go back and check something. Canvas can be tricky to find what your looking for and the dashboard display is awkward. I'd like to add more tiles to the screen and move them around to correspond to the different roles that I have on campus. Signing up for career advising appointments requires scrolling down and checking lots of boxes. Can we figure out something else? ORA it is just awful. No IT support at all for my work group. It took nearly a week to get my IU-assigned computer back up and running and three guys to figure out why I was locked out of ADS when I changed my password. They did way too much of saying nobody was assigned to support my group and not enough of ""Get me back online so I can do my job with the equipment the university assigned me to do it with.""""Need a helpline for the big machines (Karst, BigRed). My scripts would fail and the email notifications would not get sent out so that I could go back in and edit my job and submit again. Need KBs for the big machines as well. Nothing out there with graphics, basic commands, etc. for new users to get up to speed with. You're dependent on some other user telling you what you need to know and how to troubleshoot when things go wrong. That's not helping students stay in STIM when their first experience is more frustrating and time consuming than it needs to be.""For the first time in three years, my workgroup's data line to the bunker at the bypass did not get disrupted over Spring Break. Incredibly painful to not have access to systems you need because it takes a week to reestablish services because folks are saying ""that shouldn't happen"". Um, yeah it did. Now how do we fix it so we can get back to work? ""Overall UITS does a good job and I've found them to be helpful, patient, persistent and caring under trying circumstances.""Footprints, as implemented, could be better. The acknowledgements result in duplicate email messages. It creates more messages than should be required.""For the most part, my interactions with UITS have been positive. I have enjoyed the various different training classes I have taken through UITS, the way they are structured, and the fact that you seek feedback on them immediately and adjust accordingly. There have, of course, been those times where I contact UITS for help with something and either get an extremely delayed response, or get rather rudely told to contact someone else. These are less common, but still occur.""Generally, I'm really happy with the services UITS offers! The only two areas in which I would be happy to see an improvement are in some wireless network coverage gaps in the RTVS building and the Android interface for IU Mobile. It doesn't handle Kuali Time well at all."Great support from LSP Services as usual. [IRD] in particular doing great work.Support from office@iu.edu could be a little better (slow response).Wireless network access in SRSC could use strengthening (sometimes have to switch to LTE)."I always go away a happy customer in my dealing with UITS, but I am a little concerned about the "focus on security issues and how it would impact my freedom to configurecomputer hardware."I always have a good interaction with [IRD] when I have questions regarding IUIE data group problems, or how tables are built. I appreciate his attentiveness and his quick responses to my questions.""I always talk to someone who's friendly and supportive, and nearly always resolve the issue I have."I am a newer employee. A technology on boarding for IT pros would be helpful. There is a lot of information to absorb and navigating and finding the correct resources has been challenging. Some policies seem unnecessarily complicated and out of touch with practical day to day operations.I am served by EITS and they are wonderful."I am very pleased with the services provided by UITS. While my interactions are limited, I take that as a good sign."I appreciate the help that UITS staff gives.I called the center to speak to the rep. who had just emailed me to call him. A woman spent 20 minutes looking for him and then told me they had no one working there by that name which is not true since he emailed me again today!!I can speak only of positive experience with UITS staff and services. In this specific survey I do want to single out [IRD] and his colleagues for smoothing our transition from manual management to SCCM management. His entire team was available as needed for helping me and my team through that transition."I consider taking this survey a negative UITS experience because you don't give up until I take it. The emails are personalized, making me feel observed and harassed. I don't trust that I could choose not to take the survey without consequences, and I suspect my privacy will broken. I'm taking this survey grudgingly."I do not feel I've used the services enough to provide the input you need.I don't interact often with UITS staff as the School of Informatics and Computing has their own tech support team.I don't like that my phone only works when I'm logged into my computer...missed a few calls this way.I find it helpful to chat with UITS online since I'm not able to call or come in person during most of the day."I find the people who staff the help desks to be incredibly helpful, as are our library IT staff. I also really appreciate the classes you offer. I do wish you'd consider offering more advanced classes and especially more long-term classes, with homework, where we could have the opportunity to practice and get feedback."We've been looking for an advanced class in Word macros and VBA for years. Any help finding resources on that would be greatly appreciated."We are constantly having meltdowns with Outlook in our department that causes us to miss important emails or send emails that get stuck in the outbox. We can get around this by using the web app, but I don't see why this has been a lingering issue."Lync is a nightmare. I'm always missing calls and the phone will suddenly go dead. I have a brand new computer and I've read the very sparse support info. "Overall though, I feel so privileged to have access to the technology and support at IU. Thank you!""I have always been a big user and supporter of WordPress and I'd be happy to see much more support and enthusiasm for this platform at IU. Many Universities are leveraging WordPress as their primary website infrastructure and here at IU yet it seems to always get discouraged/pushed away in favor of Hannon Hill Cascade Server. WordPress can be implemented securely and successfully as proven by many institutions like Boston University and University of Washington. Even with the new HHCS ""Framework"", HHCS is not as approachable/usable as WordPress on Webserve and it seems many departments and groups would like to use WordPress (Media School, Medical School, Research Groups, etc.). If nothing else, much more support and coordination between HHCS and WordPress would be very helpful and useful."I have chatted online several times with the UITS help desk staff. Have always been very helpful.I have had a great experience with all IT staff. [IRD] in particular has been outstanding!I have had great experiences working with any issue I have had. Very prompt service."I have had NUMEROUS positive experiences with UITS. The only issues I have had are related to not having support in our building. While we have wonderful IT staff with such positive attitudes who get to us as quickly as possible, it is often difficult when they are pulled in many different directions and have a trip either across campus or off campus to contend with. It would be very helpful to us if we had IT support in our on-campus building.""I have limited contact with UITS staff as I tend to communicate through my department's specific IT personnel. However on the occasions where I need help specifically from UITS, I have often found that I don't get direct answers and solutions take weeks or months to come up with."I have never had a negative interaction with the UITS staff. The system is another story.I have not had negative interactions with UITS staff or services. I have taken several of the IT Training courses and found those to be helpful. I would find it beneficial if IT Training continued to expand what software they provide these trainings on - having a session or two on Tableau would definitely be helpful."I have only been an employee for a short time so my responses reflect the last 6 months. During this time, the system I use has not been reliable...the phone doesn't come on at times on a regular basis, the laptop does not transfer the image over to my desktop, Outlook doesn't load at times, and my screens, just recently, have been locking up. Oftentimes, I have to shut down the system a couple of times when I initially log on to get things working. And sometimes, they still don't work. I appreciate the continued trouble shooting services provided but it gets a little frustrating to have had these problems on a consistent basis. Therefore, my responses reflect this frustration. Is it possible to get a new system to use that's consistent, and move the trouble-shooting to your department to determine the problems with the various components of my system? This way, I could be more efficient and effective doing my work. Just a thought. Thank you."I have only had positive experiences with UITS. My only concerns are the recent declines in staffing that jeopardize the timeliness of responses."I have only one comment regarding IT training courses offered. The courses I see are for Excel and other desktop applications, which I don't consider IT, but I'm sure those courses fill a need. "I'm wondering if you offer training for network management or router configuration? I'm thinking CCNA but not quite that deep. Additional training in network management would be helpful in my position as a broadcast engineer.ThanksI have really enjoyed the UITS classes that I've attended and am grateful that these no longer have fees."I have responsibility for [IRD] computing resources across all campuses. I have to work with UITS units at each campus. While the individuals on each campus are helpful and cooperative, it is sometimes frustrating to have to try to coordinate with so many different units. It would be helpful to have all [IRD] resources centrally managed, in a single [IRD] OU, with centrally managed GPOs etc. Local UITS personnel from each campus could be granted admin rights over machines at their campus, so as to enable them to provide local support, while also maintaining central management.""I have struggled working with HelpNet since I started my position [IRD]. I have found that while there is a very quick response rate for the HelpNet employees when a ticket it submitted, oftentimes they are unable to fix the problem or provide a ""Band-Aid"" solution that causes things to worsen. For example, I was having trouble with multiple email accounts that are all linked to Outlook when I open it. Any emails I was sending from three different accounts, were showing up in my Sent folder for my personal account. I made sure to select the correct account in the ""From"" drop down, but it would never make a difference. This meant that we were unable to use our accounts in the intended manner, due to this technological issue. When a HelpNet employee responded, they stated that there was nothing that they could do -- even though there were other users in my office who had the accounts working properly. Another individual from HelpNet came later and stated that my account was set up incorrectly, and reformatted it so that the emails were sending properly, the same as every other user in my office. A few days later, the original employee came back to look at my account again and stated that my account was now set up incorrectly and reverted everything back to the way it was originally. This is not an unusual pattern -- I have found myself not calling HelpNet for assistance because I have found that there have been times when their assistance has made things worse and have caused more work for myself. ""Further, there is one HelpNet employee who comes to our office often who has been very dismissive of my concerns and unwilling to explain options further, focusing specifically on the one solution that he was willing to offer at the time. An example of this was when I was concerned about being asked to log into our kiosk iPads with my personal username and passphrase. I fully understand why this is needed, however, I wanted to consult with my supervisor first to determine who would be the appropriate person to enter their credentials. When I asked for more information to explain to my supervisor the situation, he placed the iPads down on the desk in a flippant manner and then said, ""Call me when you and [INSERT NAME] figure it out."" He then left the office. Another example is when he got into a heated argument with an employee in our office because the employee in our office felt like the HelpNet employee was saying that the issues were operator error, when she specifically documented the issue she was experiencing. While this was a two-way argument - and it is not the sole responsibility of one party, it was a moment about HelpNet services that caused tension and awkwardness within our work environment .""I have utilized the walk-in UITS service at the Wells Library to add money to my IU staff ID card so I can print at the Student Technology center computer labs. The UITS people at Wells have been helpful. I work for the [IRD], so for work-related technology issues, I contact CITO first (not UITS). I would like to learn more about how to utilize Wi-Fi services on campus, using my Smart Phone (Android)."I like the new KFS dashboard and find one.iu.edu easy to use as well. I appreciate the information you share about phishing issues and other things that are going on.I love the Knowledge Base. It is fantastic."I love UITS! The breadth of services from training (both online and in person), software (IUanyware rocks!!) and reliability of internet speeds is amazing!""I love UITS. They are always friendly, patient and helpful.""I might have called UITS once this year; if so, they helped me rapidly and effectively! Normally, I ask CITO for help since I am employed by the [IRD]. They, too, are excellent. When you ask my satisfaction with Microsoft Exchange/Outlook/Outlook Web Application: I love Outlook and I HATE Outlook Web App (so much so that I only use it in extreme need). The Lync/Skype phone system is OK but TOO DIFFICULT to transfer calls; I can do it but others in my office have a lot of trouble. iGPS Course Search is too deeply layered, i.e. I have to drill down very far (many clicks) to find out if a course is still open. I much MUCH prefer the old SIS Course Search and REALLY hope you don't EVER take that away from us advisors. It is SO much faster.""I needed to purchase a new cell phone after I had already registered an old phone with Duo, and it would have been beneficial to have clearer instructions on how to walk me through the process.""I rarely interact with the staff, so I have no comments. As for the services, I use them everyday and have no complaints.""I really haven't had any issues that has brought the need to communicate directly with UITS. In general, I've not had any problems with IU technology. My only comment would be that IU Secure would connect a little better in places such as Memorial Stadium and the parking lot around the stadium on game days. It has seemed to have gotten better however."I so appreciate that if I have issues on my home computer I can phone and get assistance to do my work at home.I think the most prominent issue I face is the lack of coordination and cooperation between CITO and UITS. As a staff member of a unit within the College it is endlessly frustrating to be shuttled back and forth from CITO to UITS and vice versa for issues when neither is sure who should take responsibility for resolving the problem. There are occasions when the two support teams need to work together and they rarely ever do so efficiently or smoothly.I think the services are performed very well. I have always had help right away. Issues were solved quickly. Thank you for your support."I think the UITS help desk is fabulous, in 20 years I have consistently experienced success with these individuals and they remain unrattled in their approach, patient, kind, and resourceful. This speaks to the training they receive as they take on this challenge.""The knowledge base is a great tool, but frequently it is written from a technical perspective, not a user perspective who can't understand or has no knowledge about the system framework or vocabulary terms used within the knowledge base. I think it would help to have the language redone to consider that perspective, adding, less technical terms in ( ) would go along way. Finally, adding pictures of what the screens might look like would also help. Recently, a co-worked couldn't comprehend how slashtmp worked and I couldn't understand the instructions completely either, but due to my background, I was willing to play with the system, using my double monitors, I had instructions up and tried various options using my gmail to see how it worked, then I print screened the steps as they occurred interspersing and re-writing the Knowledge base instructions so they were more first-time user friendly. I do this from my ""educator"" framework.""Overall, I think UITS does a tremendous job, keeping so many systems ready to go for thousands with an eye on possible hacks, security threats, and capacity and use of system constantly. I am grateful everyday for the systems your provide as I hum along, navigating many features everyday! Thanks so much and keep up the good work!""I think the UITS staff does a great job, sometimes they are a little slow to respond but then again, it is a big university. The one service that I am deeply disappointed in is the ability that we once had to purchase software as an employee for a discounted rate. It was super nice to buy accounting or book keeping software...etc."I understand the importance of security but there needs to be a balance between too much security that does not allow us to complete our jobs.I usually have very positive interactions with UITS."I am usually using HPC system for my bioinformatics research projects. If UITS HPC team had more computing scientists or senior computing engineers who are not only strong in computing hardware and software but also strong in both structural bioinformatics and genomic bioinformatics, we could then seek deeper and more broaden services or help from UITS in our research projects. I am satisfactory that UITS have a strong team in HPC system and software maintenance. The team always provides right or alternative solutions for my questions.""I utilize the tech folks in our building frequently and they are wonderful! I have used some of the software that we can get from IUWARE, and that's about it. The lynx system SLOWS down job function for those who have to transfer phone. Instead of an instant process it take 30+ seconds to do it...very frustrating."I was disappointed when Lynda.com was cancelled and was one of the people who used it quite a bit. It was very useful and wish we still had access to it.I was hired as a [IRD]. I've had very positive experiences with UITS. I got help setting up my email on my phone and getting a token for the Duo two-step login.I went to the UITS help desk at the Wells Library just last week for help with my Droid phone dropping the IU secure network. The person I spoke with blamed IU Secure and was not really able to help me. He just dismissed my problem saying there was nothing he could do.I wish there was a way to turn off the graphics on One.IU and instead just see the choices listed alphabetically."The migration from SP2010 and Nintex workflows to SP Online and K2 Appit has been stressful and frustrating. There needs to be more individual contact and assistance, and more prompt responses when questions are asked.""I work in RPS and work through our AIT staff, who then will refer a work request to UITS as/if needed. The process is satisfactory."I work in the Wells library and have had good experiences whenever I ask the UITS folks in the lobby for help.I'm also always impressed with the 855-6789 help line.And the Knowledge Base is usually helpful."I work with financial systems and have used a token to access systems for years. When DUO came about, I added my cell phone to be able to access my personal data from home. The system now defaults to my cell for authentication and I would prefer that it default to my token. In a chat with UITS, they told me that the token was never meant to be the main tool for access. The token has been my only source for years. And now, some people are only using a token, no secondary. If some can have only a token, I think I should be able to make my token my default.""I worry about security. I have had some very strange things occur while working on the pc I am assigned. I am not one to open suspicious emails, etc. and I certainly do NOT share any of my passwords or account(s) information. Local IT professionals thought things to be serious enough to replace the hard drive this past year a few months prior to our replacement cycle, but the oddities have kept occurring. I wonder if there is some sort of internal problem ...?"I would like an online tutorial or in-person workshop about how to use Facebook. Also a tutorial about iTunes."If there is some kind of campus-wide outage or problem e.g. Outlook not working, it would be great to be kept informed of the situation (e.g. has the problem been reported, is it being addressed)."If we could get advance notice of system changes it would help us get things set up . Like when mail service was down and res. cards . This would have been a lot smoother for us and the HA's if we could have prepared for this."In general I do not think UITS or UISO provide the necessary volume of resources and guidance to departments concerning their individually respective internet presence. Many units pay resources outside of IU to develop their web pages. Usually because it is less expensive to hire externally than be charged by IT for the services. This is unfortunate and should be changed. It's 2017, all departments are on the internet. Are they all safe? Who knows...because I don't think anyone in IT or Security is watching. Are all systems patched, updated timely, and running anti-virus? No they are not. It's IT policy that they should be but IT does not proactively investigate and enforce their own policies.""In general my experiences with UITS have been positive and helpful. The issues I have most often do not have to do with UITS--at least I don't think they do. I'm under the [IRD] and I think RSTS doesn't allow us to do enough--for example, I can't download IU approved fonts or calibrate my monitor without RSTS assistance. If this is under your purview, PLEASE change it!""In my experience, UITS has always been top notch. I am grateful for the helpfulness and high level of expertise."Is it normal for me to have to restart my desktop computer at least once and often two times each day? This is usually because Outlook and Skype will not work."IT Support in my building is excellent, particularly [IRD]. He is extremely talented, professional, and courteous.""I know this is probably not practical given the size of the campus, but I wish we had Wi-Fi outside.""It would be helpful for someone from UITS to follow up to confirm when something has been activated or a project has been completed. While it's okay to be given an expected time frame for completion (i.e. within 3 business days), it makes it difficult to know what happened if the activation or project doesn't appear to have worked."IU Anyware is a very useful tool you have provided. I like having software available without needing to install it. It is very useful for times when I only need certain pieces of software occasionally."The degree map page is very buggy. It seems to have a timeout period, but it is not indicated by any sort of message. It simply stops being able to search or save. It is also very un-intuitive to use. It pulls too many courses (it shows current term and unscheduled courses) and students and advisors do not immediately know how to filter. Overall, it is a very clunky system.""The IT Pro communications are very well done, but it often seems like important messages to end users get lost in other information like the monitor. For many in my area, they were unaware of Lync 2010's retirement until the week before it was to be retired. This may seem like it should be the work of the local ITPro group, but they were not proactive in this situation in communication or execution. ""I also do not always know the best place to communicate issues about various systems. If I have problems with IUIE, or SIS it is unclear the best place to address those. I have a similar problem with degree map, which lists 3 different email address to direct questions to. ""Overall, I very much like and appreciate the services UITS provides. It has excellent front line, good how-to documentation, a reliable VPN, and I find most provided services easy to use. Thank you!""I've always gotten quick resolutions to issues I've reported. Now that I'm at the end of the survey, it would be nice to see a progress bar of some sort."I've had several chances to work with the UITS folks and I've always found those experiences pleasant and helpful.Kaltura Mediaspace - Having it seems like a needed service and very welcomed. Using it in the past I have noticed performance issues when trying to view videos which has discouraged proactive use of it."Tier 2 support - Most of the time we have direct access to the individuals that actually do the work we need done. On occasion we go through the central help desk. I am sure they are trying to be helpful, but in my experience it seems they try to solve problems that are beyond their skill and knowledge. Instead they become the middle man creating noise during the conversation which overly complicate the problem. After initial engagement I would prefer working directly with those who will be resolving the issue."Additional items - adding additional self service capabilities would be welcomed.Most of the questions were answered."Most services I know of and use are clicking along amazingly well. Hardware in some STC rooms is getting long in the tooth. IUAnyware is amazing when not too many are using it, it slows down a lot by mid-semester. Interface to cloud storage gets particularly slow. ""I would like to see support for Onedrive and Google drive to be considered secure. I find their functionality and speed greater than Box. (They're both better capitalized, I imagine.) ""I'm sure you're well aware IU Secure slows down and begins to frustrate students. Student oriented social media becomes a litany of complaint about it around mid-semester, and finals time. ""Having to use Pulse Secure rather than built-in VPN options is slow and painful. Particularly frustrating to have to toggle apps on phones between Wi-Fi, Pulse, and Duo, all just to get connected for a short time somewhere in the world, on slow Wi-Fi.""(I totally understand and agree with the need for this level of security... I'm just expressing a hope that we can get back to OS-vendor-supported, built-in options someday.)""I would also like to see Google Authenticator as an option in addition to Duo, for n-factor authentication. It would also be nice to find a vendor for inexpensive Duo-capable token generators, in case of loss/theft of smartphones, and to be able to generate a short list of single-use tokens in case of loss of all devices. Especially in today's environment of increased device-confiscation at border crossings. :(""Music ITS is a dedicated, hard working group. Thank you!""My answers were concerning my limited exposure to UITS, as since I work in the Office of Research Administration, I find that I use the services of RASD and RSTS to handle any immediate needs. My one overall frustration would be concerning when I am working on a project that needs IT development, and am told that there is such a backlog of work, it would be 2 to 3 years to begin any phase that involves programming. If there is that much demand for the time of our programmers, why are we unable to simply hire more people? I do appreciate all the help that the various IT teams have provided, and need to mention that the people I have worked with have always been kind, professional, and driven to solve any issues in an timely manner.""My experience on this instance was very good. The technician was prompt, courteous, and efficient."My experiences are always satisfactory.N/ANoneNone."Not completely dissatisfied with anything, but there is room for improving all of it.""Most of my problems stem from not enough training when something new is coming out, or an upgrade goes in, and then I feel like it's up to me to learn how to use it, which I generally don't feel like I have enough time to do."Zoom is the most recent example."Not enough log in ""keys"" for everyone who wants one for Duo."Nothing but nice things to say about IT both in my department and when I've had to access services at the library.On most issues the person I talk to can fix the issues we are having. Other times it takes a while to get results."On the rare occasion I've had to call in from home, your staff has been very polite and helpful.""On the rare occasions when I've needed to call for support, I've gotten quick and effective assistance. I very much appreciate the availability and usability of services such as IUware, IUanyWare, and Box. Overall, I feel like the resources available to us remain timely and up-to-date. The only recurring issues for me have been outages that affect Exchange/Outlook connectivity, which is central to my work.""One comment on IU Secure: during my busy season, I work long days. IU Secure will kick me off after so many hours (not exactly sure how many) and I have to log into the system again. This is problematic and worrisome, as I want to be certain my documents are being auto saved on my network."One of the only reasons that I am completing this survey is because I want to make sure that as many people as possible know how awesome the Kelley UITS technical support is. I don't know to what extent the Kelley technical people are connected to UITS but they are amazing and amazingly helpful. They always respond quickly; they never make you feel stupid or as if you are asking a simple question that most people would be able to figure out."Our department is a CIC system user and it would be very helpful to have better training on how to use this system to it's potential. To those of us that are not technical-minded, help documentation is rarely helpful."Our UITS team is the best ever!!! :O)I have always had patient & experienced service. :O)"Over the 17 years I've been at IU, UITS has improved greatly at being customer focused (for example, this survey). Recently, I've been involved with video conferencing and the UITS staff who handle this are really great! I especially appreciate all that UITS is doing to keep the IU network safe and secure... although I frequently wish I still had admin rights to the computer I use every day."Overall experience has been good.Overall I think UITS is very good - better than other places I have worked."Overall I've been happy with all of my experiences with UITS. Whenever I needed a new computer set up or had an issue with outlook or an add-in, they responded promptly and were able to locate the problem quickly."Overall the services and assistance provided by UITS has been very satisfactory."Overall, a good experience.""Overall, I am generally happy with my interactions with UITS. I have no complaints.""Overall, I'm generally satisfied with most services. I am not satisfied, however, with departmental web support. There is very little or no support for departments without specific IT positions. The rest of us muddle through as best we can. However, when I try to access resources in regards to web publishing, I often run across outdated and inaccurate information (as I later find out) still online or, even worse, in the Knowledge Base. Please update these resources."Positive experiences with UITS staff - always found them to be willing to help in a very timely manner."Recently I emailed about a problem - I couldn't figure out how to set up the push notifications for Duo, because I already had text message notifications set up. Email replies didn't make sense, so I called and a staff person talked me through it. On the phone, he understood why it wasn't working (I wasn't starting from scratch - my phone was already in there). Not a big deal, but it was irritating that I was being emailed instructions that I had just followed on the UITS Duo website, that didn't work. ""I work at Kelley and our KSBIT staff are our main source for IT help. In fact, when I needed to send a phishing attempt, I IM'd one of our KSBIT staff to ask for the email (I was close, but had the extension wrong)."I usually only use UITS for issues to do with campus things (Duo) rather than things at my computer or desk.Services for the phone system seem to be incredibly slow and unresponsive.Persistent Outlook issues are getting very tiresome."The new Duo is cumbersome. If I'm bouncing between systems, I may have to two-factor several times a day. It seems strange that it does not recognize a frequently used machine. I have to answer too many questions from others who don't know how to use it.""Since I am in the COAS, a lot of these questions did not apply to me.""SIS is a pretty outdated and bug-ridden system. It is by far my biggest overall frustration in working for the university, and needs an overhaul.""Skype for business isn't as good as Lync was from a user standpoint. However, it doesn't crash as often as Lync did. I don't like how difficult it is to manage my contacts. It would be nice to see the user interface updated for all of the administrative services we use. An iPhone app to manage ePTO that works well and looks good on mobile and on laptop would be great. I'm continually frustrated with the WCMS because you have to expand EVERYTHING to see where you are on the page and to add or edit content. It was easier in the old version to see everything because the boxes didn't need to be expanded. "I've not had any issues with any staff."Also, I have a HIGH volume of spam messages going into my inbox. I've created rules, and a lot of them now go to junk, but I am still receiving many of them in the inbox. I have hundreds in my junk folder over a weekend. I don't feel like the IU junk censors are doing a great job.""Some UITS groups are very disorganized and communicate poorly - in particular, it's difficult to get the correct information about teaching and learning pilot programs. Also, it seems like a lot of the pilot initiatives don't really meet user needs, which is frustrating. The support center is a mixed bag, depending on the consultant you get. IT Training is fantastic. The Skype/Lync people have terrible customer service and don't seem to know what they're doing.""Staff is always super friendly and helpful. They do seem to have issues with the plotter printers - it takes way longer than it should just getting things set up to print, but I appreciate having this as an on-campus service."Telecom requests do not get answered in a timely manner. I have had two requests in [IRD] that have virtually been ignored for weeks until I contact someone personally.The Casper service is critical to compliance with IT policy. If UITS wants departments to actually follow IT policy then this tool must be supplied to the university departments at no cost. SCCM and Active Directory are provided to departments at essentially no cost. Without Casper/Jamf we have no real way to actually be in compliance with IT policy."Research Technologies needs to do a much better job of telling departments and specifically researchers about services like Karst, IU GitHub and other central systems that can help researchers meet their needs. These systems also help with IT policy compliance by allowing researchers to use managed systems so they are not trying to manage their own servers outside of IT policy. UITS needs to do more in this area of supplying expertly run systems that departments can utilize for their research goals."IU Print for departments is a great thing but like other services you need to actually support that system and be more responsive to service requests and provide the cross platform configuration files and information through already established systems like IUware and the KB. Casper and SCCM are tools that should also be used for the distribution of IU Print configurations."The fact that the quality of basic IT support varies across campus (ExecIT vs. Helpnet, for example) drives me nuts. As nice as the Helpnet guys might be (And some of them are not at all nice and consider any questions to be a burden on their time), more often than not they're left to Googling solutions to basic IT issues. I've started just doing that on my own instead of bothering to make a request. At least that way I know no one will be rude to me.""The few times I have had to call UITS for help, everyone has been very helpful. I do at times have issues with getting connected to the wireless on campus. It would be nice if that didn't seem to be so difficult.""The important instructions for Lync/Skype telephone functions seem to change with every software revision and are not circulated. I have not been able to successfully transfer or merge a call since the first system upgrade. Instructions received at the time of adoption are no longer accurate, and no new instructions have been distributed. I don't know where to find them or who to ask.""The switch to IU Box (following OnCourse project site retirement) has been frustrating. Box is incredibly slow at my university workstation. There was no provision with OnCourse retirement to batch transfer files from the old system to a new system. Senior level staff and faculty end up spending hours of time in the mindless task of individually, manually downloading files from the system that is to be retired and uploading them to the new system if you don't give us an automatic batch conversion tool."The IT personnel internal to the School of Public Health are exceptional. They have assisted me with troubleshooting my work iPad and replacement. The wireless network in the basement of the School of Public Health building is sporadic. I cannot keep a steady connection on my smartphone or my laptop (MacBook Pro).This is distracting when I am in meetings and have to utilize the internet on my personal devices.The IT support staff in psychology are consistently wonderful!!"Internet has been a bit of a problem in certain areas of the psychology building (second floor, research labs hallway) and one wired computer losing connection periodically as well. This could be improved. "Sometimes emails (which I'm told were sent to me) do not come through to my inbox or are delayed in coming to my inbox. This poses a major inconvenience.The new two-step login is incredibly obnoxious and I hate that it is mandatory. I don't always have my phone available when I want to check my email on a computer. What if my phone dies when I am using a computer away from home? Guess I can't access IU services anymore!The on site service in Athletics is fantastic. The inability to email a link is inconvenient and I wish more emails went out explaining why and how to get around this problem and still send informative emails.I still don't know how to use my phone. Outlook is terrible. Please change to gmail. The duo process is inconvenient. Please get rid of that double step process. One.iu is still hard to navigate and keep my homepage with the items I need. The financial reimbursement system is a pain and not user friendly. It also takes too long to get reimbursed. Thank you."The One.iu.edu landing page makes me cringe. The organization seems totally random and it's difficult to find topics, requiring you to know the name of the system/program you need, rather than what it does. Plus, nothing is alphabetized! Please put the things in alpha order, and maybe allow a search by what you are trying to do (""enter time"") rather than the name of the system you need to use (who knows what Kuali is?).""The only concern I can think of to mention is the linking of my phone to my work station. While I understand the logic and financial reasoning behind this situation, the link has made my phone much less, rather than much more, functional.""I also have problems now with my mobile device and my IU e-mail account, but I'm not sure whether that problem--which surfaced with my ""upgrade"" to a new phone--is the fault of the service provider or new security protocols at IU. Even my in-house department IT guys couldn't get my phone to accept IU e-mail.""I guess I would also say I'm complacent about UITS services. I take them/it for granted, but suspect that when I step away from IU I will recognize how much service/protection they provide. So thank you for that!""The only concerns I have are with the slight aggravation related to updates on software like Skype, Adobe, and others that require admin rights and therefore I have to get UITS or ETS staff to take care of such a simple, yet persistent, issue.""The only real interaction I have had with IT is really the staff at IUHC. [IRD] and [IRD] are excellent, but only having one of these as full time is really a detriment to this facility. There are enough issues that could be covered full time by these two employees, and the load could be divided more evenly, resulting in a better work place. These two employees in particular are knowledgeable, considerate, and are a joy to work with, but they seem to have a lot on their plate that could be more evenly divided with more work hours allowed."The only snafu that happens regularly is silly and very minor: The transcription of IU Voice Mail messaging into our Outlook email never translates in any way close to the original message!!! It could easily be considered alien or an excellent source for comedians. Might we just get rid of that feature?!"The overall technical support is ok, but majority of the UITS Help Desks usually do not offer in-depth solutions to the posted problems. Instead those IT students usually refer everybody to search the Internet for the answers and possible solutions for the problem at hand. Not good. When I come to Help Desk to reach for help I don't want to be sent off to some other sources to look for a possible solution to my problem. That's what the Help Desk should be for. One more thing. When you come to Help Desk with a problem and are trying to describe it with your own words, the people at Help Desk expect for you to ""speak their IT language"". Otherwise they will not make any effort to try to ""translate"" the issue you are describing into the realm of pro IT language and terms. In other words, if you don't speak IT ""language"" you better stay away from the Help Desk for no real help is awaiting you there. Sad. Very sad. Waste of my time...."The phone system is the WORST. I get echoes in my calls regularly. Transferring process is getting worse instead of better. You can't relay/shorthand a customer's message to another department before transferring the customer - so they have to start over with a new department. Frustrating.The transition of my profile from IUPUI to IU has been rocky. The profile is attached to many things and I have been discovering them one-by-one."The UITS staff members have always been helpful and considerate, and well prepared to answer my questions.""The UITS staff that reside at the IUF that work with us at the IUAA are very helpful and very responsive. They are kind and we enjoy working with them. Outside of the staffing I do believe however that the Duo system is overkill, every single time you log in is inconvenient."My iPhone does not trust the wireless on campus now for some reason. It consistently says there is a security issue. Could this be due to the new security you have put into place? Not being able to use the Wi-Fi is disappointing."UITS in person support has been great, sometimes can be slow depending on availability."UITS has always been very helpful to me."UITS has always made computer/internet issues easy to correct, I have no problems with your support staff at all! ""There is one area I feel that could be improved on, although it is rather specific to myself and not to campus. I work in MSB2, and I believe that UITS and the SPEA BITS have two separate servers in MSB2, so all Ethernet ports are either UITS or SPEA BITS owned/operated. To make it even more confusing, I switched from one office (working as a [IRD]) to a nearby office as a [IRD] for a SPEA professor. I thought it was strange that SPEA and University networks had such a hard time communicating with each other (in a physical sense with computers/networks, all support staff on both sides are extremely helpful)."UITS has always worked hard to help and fix McNutt problems.UITS has been very helpful.I find having to have the token to sign in to most things rather annoying.UITS have always been very knowledgeable and helpful in resolving my issues."UITS is doing a good job, but I feel some units are understaffed, such as the SCCM group.""UITS is great! I love the consultants: they are always available, they are patient, they understand multiple platforms and are both creative and persistent in looking for solutions. I have a Chromebook, which has a different kind of interface, and I know it posed an initial challenge. Thanks to UITS, we've figured it out. "I could use better instruction on Lync. I just found out I can do groups!"My only minor criticism is in training. The courses offered are on point, and the program administration is good. The content delivery is uneven.""UITS is great! When our local LSP's don't know a solution to any problem, they call on UITS for the answer."UITS is so helpful as a department. Each person I've worked with has been amazing and so very helpful! One thought. Is there any way you can get better connections in Assembly Hall during games? The internet is so slow. I know there are so many people in there. Just wondering if there was a way to connect or speed up the ability to connect. Thanks! You guys are awesome!"UITS is terrific. Great responsiveness and personal service, especially for a group with as large a footprint as it has. The people are always very helpful, friendly and accommodating.""UITS keeps everyone working! UITS adds new services that improve and streamlines the way staff, faculty, and students work.""UITS supports the IT Edge people very well, and it is always very much appreciated.""The only thing I can think to add is that the IU Fax Service should respond to their tickets. We submit things through their website, but never receive a confirmation that it was sent, nor do we get confirmation that the work has been completed. It's awesome when the service does go into effect, but it would be nice to get notification from them in some format.""Other than that, with everything and everyone UITS has to work with and serve, they do a wonderful job! "Keep up the good work!UITS staff have been very helpful in figuring out any IT problems that I've had!Usually quick and efficient reps.Very happy with UITS services."We (my office) do not rely on UITS, typically. When I've contacted UITS, they have been able to assist. I just wish that we could pick passphrases on the computer instead of visiting in person to a UITS center."We need a safe location to store MANY passwords under ONE password. It would be good to work with Purchasing to get a contract vendor for this so that IU can provide depts. with this ability without having to pay an additional fee."The people answering the hotline (5-6789) and chats don't say I don't know often enough. Giving the WRONG information is bad; saying I don't know I can escalate this issue to get you some help is better. For example, a retired staff called the hotline and got the run around, was told she didn't need a Duo method to pull her W2, but since she RETIRED, she did need it. They also told her that she would not be able to set up a new Duo method since the token she had had while working was left in the dept. but not deactivated. [IRD] fixed the situation for us with good communications. I can only participate in focus groups during the work-day if my supervisor agrees (I haven't asked yet).""We need more IT resources for system enhancements and business needs. Also, it takes too long to get a security review completed."I find KB difficult to use.The live chat online function is great. I always get good service.I miss Lynda."When someone or something has hacked my account, I do appreciate that my passphrase is reset. However, sometimes it happens two or three times a year and I never know when it will happen. The result is that I may be suddenly shut out of just about every system that I use. Then, I have to walk to a campus consultant and prove who I am. Then, that person resets my passphrase and opens my account. By the time I get back to my computer, I'm locked out and I have to then call a consultant. Surely, there is an easier way for staff, especially IT staff to get back in after an incident like that. In general, the support is very helpful.""Within the employee portal and Outlook Web Access, there seems to be a security flaw where if two members of the same household are both employees, it sometimes holds the first user's information on the computer even when they have logged out of the system. Only solution seems to be to go to a different web browser. For example, seeing the first person's employee data on pop-up screens even after re-logging in with the second user's credentials."Would love to see more resources to help administrative departments with Business Intelligence projects for the good of IU administrative decision support.

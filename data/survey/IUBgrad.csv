text"All issues I have had they have told me are external vendor issues. I would say that either means they're doing a great job, or everything important is outsourced.""Brought my computer into UITS at Wells because it was slow, and a member of your staff downloaded software that my computer did not support and I was unable to get past the login screen for almost a week. Then took it back and a different member got me back up and running, but my computer was easily twice as slow as when I originally brought it in, it's borderline unusable now. "Please make sure your staff are more careful and knowledgeable.Canvas has been having outages lately."Knowledge Base can be very confusing, but helpful if you keep digging for information.""Canvas is clunky and doesn't allow me the freedom in grading that Oncourse did. I've been working with various IU systems for [IRD] years and it seems like each of these shifts add some new tools, but take away some very important ones. It would be great if we could give feedback before these big changes occur.""The Duo system is extremely inconvenient and doesn't make me feel any safer. The frustrations of not being able to log in because I don't have my phone with me that day are immense, and can have serious impacts on my ability to teach. I've taken to having to put all my class materials up on a non-IU webpage just so I can be guaranteed the ability to reach it if my phone battery dies or I leave it at home some days.""Canvas is terrible, and seems to be getting worse.""It at least used to automatically run submitted papers through Turnitin, but now I have to load an obnoxious external tool that doesn't work properly when it comes to actually downloading my students papers for review, checking originality reports, etc.""There is no way, that I know of, to associate a lecture class with its individual discussion sections. I'm sure there are differences of opinion on exactly how to structure such a connection, but at the very least I should be able to identify which students in the lecture class are associated with which section, sort their assignments appropriately, etc.""The email system through Canvas is a disaster. At least half of the time I do not receive attachments that my students try to send me through the Canvas email system. Sometimes I don't get their emails at all (although that may just be them not really sending them when they say that they do). When I respond through Umail to a canvas message, Canvas does not register that I have read the email, and so I have alerts that I have new messages until I open canvas and open the message itself, and even then the alert only goes away about half the time, or it goes away only when I receive a new alert, which means I don't know whether I actually have a new email from a student or am just being told that I have a new email that I have in fact already responded to."Duo login is a hassle--could there be a way to only require it for a select few IU sites that conceal highly personal information or allow each person a code to use for a set period of time rather than requesting a new one every single login?"DUO Login is awful, it is a waste of time for every application. I understand for sensitive information such as my tax, pay stubs, etc. But requiring DUO for everything is not only a hassle but provides no benefit."Duo login is inconvenient. The instructions on how to connect the duo app to your phone so you don't have to get a call after you have matched duo to your phone is unclear and doesn't work for people who have already linked duo on their phones and forgot to download the app. It is already really annoying that our passwords have to be very long. Canvas is not mobile friendly."Faster computers, faster network, less use of Duo for all Canvas logins.""First, the negative. I have noticed that none of the IT interfaces for any electronic service the university offers is either intuitive or user-friendly. On the contrary, I have found all of them to be quite convoluted, laden with technical jargon, ill-organized, and obviously oriented towards an IT audience's use, instead of a student audience's. For any actually useful applications of the systems, I have had to rely on either fellow student word of mouth or time-costly trial and error. Even the IT presentation I received as part of my orientation was obviously an afterthought for the presenter, who was required to present SOMETHING to the students, but who nevertheless neglected to introduce himself, quickly glossed over things that seemed to have been possibly critical to functioning within the digital environment of IU, and who also spoke entirely in his own dialect of IT throughout. I have discussed my IU IT experiences with fellow students and found them to not be isolated. In short, IU's IT resources are prodigious and offer AMAZING services, but getting to those services seems like a form of Machiavellian torture made more darkly comical because we are forced to rely on them to function here. By the way, I work for the [IRD], so I understand better than most the exact nature of that construct! ""Now, the positive: ""I could not access my email and, after running into walls gaining access by using the system's not-so-helpful online instructions, and after then fortunately receiving detailed instructions from a friend who had experienced the same thing, I found the UITS desk and had an excellent interaction with the two agents there. They quickly and politely resolved my issue and even seemed genuinely pleased that the issue was resolved. They were awesome."Friendly and helpful. Obviously there are limitations on what UITS can do with hardware but their advice has been very sound and educative."From when I started at IU about 6 years ago, IU Secure has improved tremendously.""Generally, good so far.""Hardware, scanners. At non-IU campuses I've had access to and used top-down image capture ""scanners"" that are self-contained units (no messing with programs on an attached computer). You hold or lay the book open, press a touch screen or foot-pedal to capture the image, then it crops the image for you and separates it into the two distinct pages of the book. You can compile a file this way then save it to a usb or email. Makes it much easier and faster to scan lengthy articles and books, which I frequently do for my graduate research. Would love access to a machine of this type.""I am a distance learner, so many of these questions did not apply to me."I am an online student and have not had any experiences with IT staff. It would be great if you had more Google Tools like LucidChart available for students.I am satisfied with most of the UITS services. UITS has been able to help me several times in the past and it was always a pleasant experience. The only aspect that I think could be improved is the class registration website - it's not always intuitive. Thank you for providing information technology services on campus - it's very helpful.-[IRD]"I appreciate the role of UITS, the updates provided on the Listserve, the online courses available for basic skills such as Excel, and assistance."I can't get on IU secure since being forced to change my password. It's very annoying. It's on me though to see IT so it's not necessarily your fault.I don't know why I often get 1+ phishing email and fake emails per week from IU or mail"I found the notification about two-step login to be way overdone, but the actual instructions for setting up and especially activating it to be lacking. Also, instructions for how to set up the VPN were clear, but very challenging to find in the first place.""I had issues for [IRD] years trying to connect my phone, computer, and other device to the IU intranet/Wi-Fi. My repeated calls and inquiries were given to entry level workers and nothing was done besides giving me nonsensical excuses. ""It is just your computer. It is because you are using windows 7. It is because you are using windows 8 (after switching). You are not listed as a student. Are you sure you are a student? We don't have any record of you having any issues in the past"" This has negatively impacted my education as I depend on this technology to treat patients on a daily basis. My account was finally fixed (meaning it worked some of the time) my final semester. I would discourage other students from IU professional programs based on this experience."I have all the positive experiences with UITS."I have almost no experience with UITS staff or services, unless downloading software through IU Any Ware counts. Sometimes IU Secure does not work very effectively at my office in Ballantine Hall.""I have found the software on IUWare most helpful because it has saved me time and money figuring out which anti-virus software or which version of Microsoft Word to purchase. I do not necessarily have the best computer software knowledge, so it was helpful to have a few options supported by IU all in one location.""I find Canvas a lot easier to navigate in comparison to Oncourse, but I do miss the messaging feature on Oncourse that separated the messages in my inbox by class section. On Canvas, all the messages are lumped in one inbox which is slightly annoying. One of the best features of Canvas is the fact that it lists what assignments are due and which ones are coming up. The calendar of assignments helps to keep me organized.""As you have probably already heard countless complaints about, I do not understand why I need duo login for every application even as an IU employee. I understand having it for financial records, but do I really need it for Canvas? All I want to do is check to see if the professor put up the assignment portal, and I have to go through a complete extra step when logging in. Sometimes my phone and extra device are not near me either. My roommate also is now terrified to lose her phone because, unlike myself, she does not have a secondary device like a tablet to download the duo app on. If she loses her phone, then she cannot access anything for class or even her email to keep in communication with her professors and classmates.""I have had no interactions with UITS staff or any services beyond using the software provided by UITS (Canvas, IUWare, IU Secure, etc.) as requested for courses and other interactions with the University.""I have had NO negative interactions with UITS staff at all. I spend a lot of time in the Cook Music Library, and print most of my materials for teaching and class (I'm a [IRD]) there. On several occasions, I've had to grab the attention of the on-duty UITS staff person and they have been responsive, kind, and completed the task of fixing what needed to be fixed promptly (be it telling me I needed to add more money to my print allowance or refilling paper into the printer)."I have had positive experiences with the UITS staff in the computer lab in IMU both this semester and last semester. They explained what steps I needed to take to directly or indirectly solve my problems with UITS technology such as the printing system (via email) malfunctioning."I have had positive interactions in person and via chat with UITS. Overall, one of the best IT services I have ever dealt with.""I have not had any in-person experience with UITS; I am a distance student, though, so the services are key to my successful participation in classes. So far, I've mostly been satisfied."I have relied heavily on UITS staff for help. All my experiences are positive. I am very satisfied."I purchased a new laptop at the beginning of the school year and needed help installing everything. For the most part UITS Support Center was very helpful and kind as I came with all kinds of questions and concerns. However, a few months later my computer was attacked with malware and I didn't know what to do. When I took my laptop in to UITS for help, the person I interacted with was (understandably but it wasn't helpful) upset that I'd let it happen. I felt like shit after that encounter and on some level I realized that I hadn't gone in to get help sooner because I dreaded a reaction like that. The next person I worked with who helped me reinstall my operating system was very kind and supportive."I sent some emails to ask about how to use supercomputers in IU. I got some good answers. Thank you!"I was having issues with my computer switching between IU secure and my home Wi-Fi, and I believe I called someone named [IRD] (maybe?) who was a big help in helping me navigate through the mysterious world of the command prompt. He was patient, wasn't patronizing despite the probably easy fix this was, and made genuine conversation when we had to wait on restarts etc. I just like when people can be authentic and not drone.""I would like a bit more flexibility in scheduling jobs/submitting to Karst, or more queue options that suit different usage cases for shorted jobs that can hit a node faster.""I would like for there to be an option to opt out of the dual-authentication system for some employees, as the process makes signing in to one.iu considerably less accessible when one doesn't have a compatible second device nearby, makes the process last two or three times as long as it needs to, and all for relatively little reward -- there is little information in my one.iu account that requires this level of over-security.""I would love a map of where printers are around campus. I rarely print, but when I need to, I'd like to find the most conveniently located ones via a simple map of where they are, if they're locked up, when the building or lab is open."I do QUALITATIVE research and IU doesn't provide access to software (like QDA) or other software used by qualitative researchers. Enough with quantitative already.If the device is registered for that user then let it pass the duo authentication security. It's frustrating every time you need to log in through duo-authentication. What if someone has to submit a very important assignment and his/her phone is switched off or stolen."Implementing online chat form of help, it's very effective!"Making duo login remember the devices I have already used."In general, I am satisfied with everything provided by UITS. The only things that I think UITS may consider improving are the following: ""1. Increase the speed of the internet in some of the on-campus apartment buildings (e.g. Evermann, Red Bud, BBHN). The current speed is fine but still considerably slower than the ones in Campus View, Tuliptree, and other department buildings. ""2. Increase the capacity of the supercomputers. Now the waiting time on BigRed2 and Karst has increased substantially compared to last year, due to the increased demand for the service. UITS may consider increasing the supply in response to that.""Internet is way too slow for the year 2017. Network computers are also too slow, which can take up to 20 minutes to turn on! This is unacceptable for an institution of this size.""Instructions on the UITS website are not easy to understand. They seem to be written by technology folks who understand what they're writing...instead of looking at it from the lens of a person who is unfamiliar with technology. Setting up email, Duo, Box, etc., has not been as easy as it should have been.""Is there a service I can use to effectively find printers near me? Also, is it possible to connect all printers (including the desk printers) so that I can remotely send a print message?""It is very difficult to reach UITS staff and the waits to speak with one are long. I've had many issues with printing and it seems that each staff person contradicts the other. They don't seem to understand that for distance students who only come to campus occasionally, being able to utilize the technology is vital for success."It seems more often this year that printing has been down in the School of Ed library. It's also frustrating to not automatically connect to IU Secure and having to do that automatically."It seems that software at the Herman B. Wells Library Learning Commons is not uniformly installed. For example, SAS is installed on one computer and then not on the computer right next to it.""IU Secure sometimes seems to be particularly spotty on Apple devices (not sure if this is related to my particular OS...I'm running Yosemite on a Mac and iOS 10.2 on an iPhone), especially when walking between 7th and 10th. Again, this could be an anomaly, but I wanted to make someone aware of this.""IU Ware software availability has been significantly reduced, which prevents students from learning software that may be useful in the learning process."I've always been very appreciative of the good service and services provided by UITS.I've had a great experience with [IRD] from the National Center for Genome Analysis and Support (NCGAS). I had an issue running Breseq on Karst and I needed to run Breseq for a class project that was due in a few days. [IRD] helped troubleshoot with me and gave me expert advice that led to me completing my project on time. She responded to my emails promptly and with such attention to detail. I'm very grateful to her for her help."I've used some of the UITS information online, but I've never contacted UITS by phone or in person. The online supports have been helpful for finding what I needed (printing on campus, iuanywhere, iuware, vpn, etc.)."Logging in every day seems to take a long time (i.e. loading a user profile) and then stepping through one.iu.edu to get where you really want to be. Surprisingly the Duo authorization isn't as painful as I imagined.Logging on to computers in the Wells Library commons often takes a very long time. I'm unlikely to even attempt it at this point. Wireless service is also uneven across campus."Most of my interactions with UITS have been in the form of workshops. I have also sent in two email questions, one about file conversion and one about Box. The latter of these experiences was negative, as the responder simply sent me a link I had already explored.""Most of my UITS-related experiences involve printing. It has been frustrating at times to have to switch printing methods. Up until a year or two ago, I could print directly from Word or Acrobat or whatever program I was using. Then I had to switch to uploading documents online to My Print Center, which often did not work and was completely unavailable for several days a couple of months ago. Now I can print directly from my computer applications again, which I prefer over uploading documents to a website.""I also use campus computers sometimes, especially the ones in the IMU lab. The computers tend to be slow, though, and I only use them for programs I cannot run on my Mac.""Interactions I've had with UITS staff have been very helpful. They have not only helped me solve issues, but they have done so efficiently by quickly providing solutions or links to relevant resources.""The Duo login thing is ridiculous. We already have to use absurdly long ""passphrases"", then we have to confirm on a secondary device every time we log in?! If I log in on my phone, then I'm prompted on the same phone to confirm... it isn't even a secondary device, it is the same device! My bank, which has all of my money, just asks for a six-character password with a combination of letters and numbers, and it has me do a one-time verification when I use a new device to access my account. Why does the University need to verify every time I log in to Canvas?""Mostly all positive experiences, especially with the help personnel. I do wish it was simpler to send to campus printers from my own laptop while on campus, or at least in the library."My experiences with UITS staff are mostly positive. I have no recollection of real negative interaction. "The IU secure in WY, however, refuse to log me in occasionally. This stops me from receiving emails, for example. ""The Duo Verification is a dumb idea for non-financial services. Unless there are substantive evidences for cheating via hacking canvas, I do not understand the incentive to have Duo covering every student and faculty services. I have heard many complaints among my peers. ""The HPCs are invaluable assets in my research. My experience with HPCs are most positive. But it would be even greater if HPC team can update the compilers to gcc6, and perhaps provide a rough estimate for waiting time after one submit a job.""My only complaint is when the printers go down or run out of paper (frequently in the Godfrey Center). Also, I don't like that my computer always makes me select IU Secure and tries to log me onto ATT Wi-Fi first."No negative interactions as such.'Register for classes' web page should be considered for a Re-design to look and feel similar to IGPS.None.Nothing comes to mind."On the graduate side of the Kelley School of Business, we need better printing technology and more frequent maintenance to keep the printers from breaking down on a daily/weekly basis.""One comment for improvement. When I started out as a student, I didn't have a CAS account, and could not access any of the pages in One.IU. All I had was the credentials that I used for applying to be a student. It took me days to realize that I needed to create this account.""Embedding videos in Canvas using Caltura does not serve well. Compared to YouTube, for instance, it loads slower, and sometimes gets stuck while playing. The options, such as video resolution quality, are lesser.""Positive: 24/7 availability, always a an answer to my questions. ""Negative: stripping away software packages from lab computers, drastically and frequently changing the tools / user interface of software (e.g., Adobe PDF); requirement of security key for teachers; slowness of IU AnyWare."Printing credits make no sense to me. Why not just translate 1BW page = 1 credit or 1 color page = 2 credits."Printing: I've had some good experiences, and some bad ones. I know there are technical hurdles to this, but it still seems weird to me that getting something to print at the printer I want can be a challenge. In this regard, I'm mainly referring to mobile print, which I've had trouble with at Wells and at my on-campus office. For instance, using mobile print at Wells, is there an easier way to name the printers (e.g., ""Wells 13"")? This is compared to the complicated and technical naming convention in place (""BL_LI137_MFP1""), which has to be typed in exactly correct."Signing up for classes is painful. Canvas is great."Staff is great, Duo is a hassle and unnecessarily complicated.""The biology technical staff is great. They answer my questions and notice things about my computer that I didn't know and made it better. For UITS in general, sometimes reaching the library through pulse secure doesn't work well from off campus.""The dual login system is unnecessary, cumbersome, and annoying. There have been times when I have been unable to login to my class Canvas page on campus because I accidentally left my cell phone at home, and consequently can't get the activation codes (or whatever they are). Furthermore, the dual login system is extremely unfair to faculty or staff who may not be able to afford multiple digital devices at one time. The university seems to be assuming that everyone can afford to buy or maintain a stable cell phone plan. ""The barrier for initially learning how to navigate the many different IU web portals/pages is way too high. I feel like everything is decentralized, and each site has its own interface and rules. It's absurd that whenever IU sends me an email about doing anything online (e.g., entering in early student attendance reports), that the email contains a list of instructions for how to access the site RATHER THAN a direct URL to the site. Why is everything so cryptic and multi-stepped?"The IT services generally tend to work well only for those who have the most high end and expensive equipment such as Mac laptops. I have a Windows laptop and I couldn't even get them to install the printer on my laptop. This makes life very inconvenient which defeats the whole purpose of IT."The law school printers are often unreliable, especially when using the ""My Print Center"" program. The print system must be updated.""The main problem I usually have deals with loss of internet/Wi-Fi. I have a personal router and get internet through campus, and sometimes it goes out. Every time I've called UITS they are extremely helpful and patient with me - even when they don't end up doing anything and it's an issue on my end!""The optometry library printer breaks at least 2 times a week for the last two semesters. With such a technology advanced campus (especially with the new duo login system to access everything) It is especially difficult and frustrating to have a broken printer and have a release station. Why is it one of the libraries on campus yet the printer is very old school, outdated and cannot handle the work load of the professional students. It would benefit to have a larger, newer printer that you swipe your card in to release documents (like in the Union, and Jordan Hall, and most of the other printers on campus).""The compulink learning environment for the students to practice on continually shuts down and crashes, maybe restarting and deleting the data on the program prior to each semester could help alleviate the issues.""The projector in optometry 105 doesn't project colors properly, and the document camera in opt 105 has shadows on it and needs to be recalibrated to help with students' focus on the projected information.""The printing experience at IU is severely deficient. As a [IRD] year grad student who has experienced the printing experiences at another B1G school, I can make the comparison. IU Mobile Print seems like a second thought, and sometimes does not work. The Mac native printing experience seems nonexistent, which ignores probably a 50/50 split of use between PC/Mac.""The services provided by IU UITS is excellent. I have attended some of their certificate training workshops and have found them to be very helpful. I have also found the campus facilities well up-to-date with the latest technology. The only service that I have been asking IU UITS to purchase and to consider is a scanning kiosk (Knowledge Imaging Center (KIC)) to be placed in the Wells Library for students to scan books. Unfortunately, IU UITS has refused or denied my request several times which I do not agree. Almost 90 percent of major research universities now have a scanning kiosk from Knowledge Imaging Center. Why not IU? - [IRD]""The staff at the walk-up desk in Wells and answering chat messages are usually not experts, and are only able to help with basic issues. This is sometimes helpful, but usually the advice they can give is only what I've been able to find myself already. I've had generally positive interactions otherwise.""I have found Duo sign-in to be cumbersome and largely unnecessary. IU passwords are already long and complicated, and adding a second step just makes it more burdensome to log in. I have lost money (though admittedly not a lot) because it takes me so long to log in to Kuali Time that it appears I have arrived late to work. I am more distracted at work because I have to have my phone at my desk. It seems odd to me that when I log into IU accounts on my phone I have to switch apps in order to log in, and both authentication steps are occurring on the same device.""A minor complaint: the computers in Wells 002A are so large that if you sit anywhere further back than the 3rd computer you cannot see the board, and anywhere you sit it is impossible to see the rest of the class.""The UITS staff are friendly and helpful, however it would be helpful if they had a more visible presence in areas such as the SPEA/Kelley Info Commons; when something goes wrong with the printer there is no one to ask for help. Also, if staff could make sure that paper is always stocked in printers available for student use (outside of Wells Library) that would be greatly appreciated! Maybe even putting a little sign saying ""Have a problem with the printer? Contact UITS at ... and we will help you resolve it"" at printers would be greatly helpful."If GIS and OriginPro could be installed on more computers that would be greatly helpful."Also, I wish I could access my IU e-mail address directly through the ""mail"" app on my smartphone instead of having to go through an internet browser every time. If this is already possible, it would be great if that info was more widely disseminated."There should be more in-person technology teaching sessions available."There are strange dead spots on campus for Wi-Fi. For example, a lot of people seem to struggle with Wi-Fi in the room across from the computer lab in the basement of Wells. People also struggle to get Wi-Fi in the Lilly Library."They are indeed helpful.They have been very attentive and responsive!"To date the staff have been friendly, engaging, and helpful."Train the plotter printer student employees better."UITS is always helpful to me. 24/7 chat help is always available and it's awesome. I also like that there are computers everywhere, except that Windows 10 loads very, very slowly at startup (upon login)."UITS is an incredible service that really stands out among other university technology services I've experienced. Their 24-hour phone number and help desks have gotten me through many technology snafus in the years I've been at IU."It would help me significantly as a student if there was a quicker, easier way to print on campus. Without a printer at home, I rely on IU technology for all my printing. However, the time it takes to find an open computer, go through all my log-ins and authentications, etc., becomes quite an ordeal if I'm ever in a hurry.""Also, some sort of map or location service to find computer labs or workstations on campus (perhaps there is but I don't know about it) would be very helpful. I so often find myself looking for a place to study, and either struggling to locate computer labs in unfamiliar buildings or failing to figure out when they close at night or have classes in them. Some way to streamline this information would help me to access more of IU's technology services.""UITS staff are always friendly and helpful. The Duo authentication thing never works for me -- I'm able to get into my accounts, but it never asks me to do the Duo authentication. Not sure if that's a problem."Very good experiences with drop-in services. Quick fixes to problems. Only complaint is that sometimes printing can be unreliable in certain buildings on campus."Also, canvas is infuriatingly slow. The lag on that website reminds me of dial up internet. I love the site, it's just slow to load."What's the difference between a 3 and a 4?"When trouble arises, whether it is in the classroom, or privately owned devices, my experience both as a teacher and a student have been outstanding. I have, on several occasions, obtained requested assistance immediately and completely. I have nothing negative to say, and I sure do not know enough to suggest anything.""Whenever I have had problems using classroom technology, UITS has been very helpful."I don't like how the forwarding options between Outlook and Umail end up with some messages that are only sent to one service and not the other. I now only use Umail since Outlook wasn't able to handle my Umail forwarding."While this did not happen to me, I knew people who struggled to use the Duo system because they could not get a signal at the location of their workplace on campus. This caused them trouble clocking in and out of work. Also, the Duo system is not well-suited for those without smartphones. These people cannot just push another button to log in, because they don't have the capability to have an app on their phone.""You guys are pretty awesome and do a great job for IU. I just think the DUO login stuff SUCKS! I get that it gives us more security, but it is such a pain, it's just one more barrier to email and canvas. Can we have the option to remove it on some things? That would be helpful."

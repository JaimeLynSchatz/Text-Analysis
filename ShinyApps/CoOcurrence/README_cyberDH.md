Text Analysis with R.

View Notebooks in HTML: [cyberdh/ranalysis](http://www.indiana.edu/~cyberdh/ranalysis).

This site contains a set of demo R Scripts and Notebooks for computational analysis of literary texts; the code was originally based on that found in Matthew Jockers' Text Analysis with R for Students of Literature. 

R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. We recommend using R in conjunction with RStudio, which provides a well-designed GUI interface. RStudio uses [R itself](https://www.r-project.org) for its core code, so both R and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) should be downloaded and installed on your system.

Notebooks (.Rmd) output displayable HTML (see the link above for some examples) and PDF output. R scripts output only in the console of the client software.

Please contact us through our website [www.indiana.edu/~cyberdh](http://www.indiana.edu/~cyberdh) if you have any comments or questions.

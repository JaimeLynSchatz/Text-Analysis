Some are very helpful and pleasant, others are neither of those things. Sometimes, I must request assistance or information multiple times before UITS responds or resolves an issue."I suggest that UITS confer with faculty regarding the software offered through IUWare.I would like to see more in-person training options.N/AThey are friendly and helpful. No negative experiences. No recommendations.UITS on my campus seem VERY understaffed. They are focusing all their time on major classroom disruptions and are barely able to keep up with smaller faculty requests."Although this is my first year here at IUS, I have been very pleased with the services I have received. Everyone has been attentive listeners and have provided solid solutions to any obstacles I have had."I do not like the two-step login.I find the staff to be very supportive. Any time I have had an issue or needed assistance they have always been efficient and helpful in solving it."I have had nothing but excellent experiences with UITS staff. I think, however, Canvas never should have been adopted. It is inferior to Oncourse in my opinion. It has been a step backward, unfortunately.""I know you probably have phase-in schedules for new equipment but in my humble opinion, the computers and technology in the School of Education section seem pretty dated/limited. Consider that future teachers are passing through courses in those rooms that have lower tech than what they will work with upon graduation. Because of the slightly different set of circumstances regarding the importance of technology for our future teachers, I wish they could be on an earlier replacement/update schedule.""I prefer to speak with the technology people at IUS. They know our campus and have ready solutions. ALWAYS ALWAYS when I end up with a Bloomington tech, they spend an hour with me on the phone NOT finding a solution and then give me the direct number for our techs who typically have the solution or understand our systems better and obtain the solution directly. It is wasting my time to have to be directed to the Bloomington tech support. So on the following survey you will get mixed reviews because I am very happy with IUS tech support. Not at all happy with Bloomington tech support."I use Skype (regular) for meetings with research teams from universities across the country and found that I have to use Skype online to do this (it's less than ideal)."I would like to create a faculty webpage, and have asked for help in from several sources. I am fairly tech savvy, but programming language is out of my wheelhouse. I've used the kb, but it is not in laymen's terms. It gets to a point that I no longer understand, and I've tried. There has to be a better way for faculty who want to develop a webpage. Maybe a template we can use to fill in the basics. Is there not something like WIX to develop it?""I would love to have the faculty email work on my phone. I can receive emails, however, I can't send them.""I've had great experiences with the staff in my 2 semesters as Adjunct Faculty. I've had to call for help a few times, and service was always prompt and courteous."Local support here is wonderful."When I have to deal with the Bloomington office, it is more hit and miss - primarily because they do not understand our unique needs / setups at the regional campuses. At times, I am told to wait until I can speak to a local person to get the help I need.""My experiences with UITS at IUS have been very good. They are quick to respond, effective, and friendly."My experiences with UITS from headquarters though have not been good. The roll out of our two step login changes was not user friendly. UITS is recommending hardware (the U2F token) that does not work with the Lenovo computers used in class rooms here at IUS."I was forced to buy a U2F with my own money, only to find out that it didn't work when I tried it in my classroom. I'm currently on a waiting list to receive a single button hardware token, but apparently UITS provided IUS with a total of 25 of those devices."25 for the entire IUS campus. Seriously."My general experience has been very positive. My concerns are with Canvas problems. As a new platform, it has been very challenging at times to troubleshoot student issues from my set up issues. Staff has done well with giving me step-by-step resolutions. My chief concern has to do with setting up groups in Canvas and the fact that there is no way to correct the groups if energetic students post ahead on future assignments."No comments.Our Campus (IU Southeast) IT services have always been tremendously helpful and available."Overall, I'm satisfied and very impressed with the quality of technological services on my campus, as well as with the broad range of technological resources available to me. The only thing I don't like is Duo, which requires that I carry my smart phone with me at all times, in case I need to log into Canvas or Box while teaching a class. That gets a bit annoying at times.""Since I am not currently teaching at the university, I am unable to express my opinion. I hope to return in the future. ""I will say that during the time I was on faculty, I found the technology support to be excellent. The department assisted me in every aspect I requested.""The UITS staff at IUS are polite, understanding, helpful, and efficient."It would be nice if I did not have to use Dual to first sign in on a classroom computer and then use Dual again to sign in to use Canvas on the same classroom computer. It is hard to do in a classroom with students wanting to talk with you before a class."Two concerns - 1. When new software or operating systems are installed in classroom computers, no instructions are given on how the new system differs from the old. I have wasted valuable class time trying to figure out things that operate differently than they did 24 hours earlier (such as playing videos linked in a Power Point presentation). 2. On two occasions, I've called IT for issues with classroom computers, only to be told the computer worked fine. I've confirmed with other faculty that it wasn't just me having the issues, so I know they weren't fine. The computer in KV 015 is a disaster to work with, for instance."Two relatively minor comments:"First, my classroom [IRD] does not have up-to-date controls for the projector (for use with the classroom computer and with my own tablet). Somewhat frustrating to use (inconvenient to find and use connections for my tablet).""Second, Canvas works well, but its interface is a bit clunky. I like long file names, and these do not display well in the file list box.""I really like IUanyWare for accessing software; however, when I try to use Creo Parametric 2.0 through IUanyWare, it is so slow that it is nearly impossible to work.""The biggest issue that comes to mind is printing. As an adjunct, it is not very accessible. Students seem to struggle with this except for in computer labs.""The ITS staff are friendly, helpful, and always ready to help me. I really appreciate their hard work. Keep up the good work! "Thank you for what you do!They have been very helpful."Whenever I need help, IT is quick to assist and clear in explanations."

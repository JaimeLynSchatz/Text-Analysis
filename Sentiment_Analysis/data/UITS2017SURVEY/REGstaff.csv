I want to say that this is extremely helpful and encourage other UITS offices to consider doing the same.""Free online trainings are greatly appreciated and helpful. Equipment and most services always function as expected. Local campus UITS front-line staff are generally helpful, always quick to respond, and friendly; one UITS staff in particular is especially proactive and caring, which is sometimes abused by others in the dept. Higher level UITS staff are less helpful and friendly than most of the front line support and sometimes seem out of touch with end user issues and perspectives. The campus ""IT Services"" website could be improved to be more helpful for all current and new employees."The process for requesting service by sending a message to techworI do not like this new Duo link stuff. It is a complete hassle to always have your phone to sign into E-mail and Canvas. I believe that this is the dumbest thing that has even been implemented at IU."I had a very positive experience when I came on as a new employee. UITS staff were extremely helpful, knowledgeable, and patient. I liked the Lynda.com courses."I hate the DUO two-step login.I have had nothing but positive experiences with UITS staff.I really appreciate the improved Wi-Fi service.The technical staff has been great to work with when I've need them.Really wish the auto start programs on Thursday could get moved back 5 minutes from 5:00 AM to 5:05 AM. It would make clocking in much easier."OMG, I am so delighted to take a moment and put into writing how much I love the IT department and the UITS staff at IU Southeast. Never, have they been too busy to help me and the students in the [IRD]. The staff is kind and gentle with the older students, very helpful and patient with me, and we really appreciate all they do to assist us with our work and studies. Writing this reminds me that it has been a while since I treated them to donuts on a Friday. Got to get on my game, here. :)"Our IT people here at IU Southeast are fantastic. They are prompt and knowledgeable and never leave a problem unsolved! They are polite and straightforward."Overall, I have been pleased with our IT support on the Southeast campus. However, when I have been forwarded to individuals in Bloomington for assistance, they have been clueless and not helpful at all. Numerous times I have had to hang up on them and call back to try to get a different person who knows what they are doing."The IU Southeast UITS staff are incredibly helpful. They consistently help before the desired completion date. My only suggestion would be having them call each person before showing up at their office.I also miss having access to Lynda.com. The self-paced learning materials on ittraining.iu.edu are mostly just pdfs. The videos were more helpful.The students who work with Technology service are kind and understanding to other students needs. They always conduct themselves in the best manner possible and do not stop until the problem is solved.The two-step login is inconvenient.The UITS staff is always friendly and extremely helpful. One critique would be that some of the services offered are not advertised well and the result is people like me only discover incredibly helpful tools their junior or even senior year.The UITS staff that I have interacted with here on the IUS campus have always been very helpful and courteous. They are always ready to help with any questions or requests that I have.This survey was entirely too long!UITS department is always friendly and efficient."UITS on the Southeast campus is extremely efficient and friendly. Like many of us they have a heavy workload but never fail to respond to tickets in a timely manner. When I have an issue, I always know that I am receiving service from highly qualified individuals."We have a great technology infrastructure. My only area of concern is the consistency of network performance. I would like to see a more proactive approach to monitoring network performance and addressing issues."When calling the help desk, they are often confused and not able to answer my questions. I get a better response when redirected to my local campus."When I call our campus number for IT support help and get Bloomington I request a work order to be placed for our campus (IU Southeast) because Bloomington is not familiar with problems we are having here on our campus.The phones are a problem when it rolls over then we cannot transfer the call. The menu does not give us the option to transfer. It gets embarrassing when we have to tell someone we cannot transfer the call.A major concern is the level of training the students at the Help Desk receive. They don't seem to be able to answer simple questions and seem confused about things. There seems to be very little communication between UITS and the rest of the campus as well.I have had only positive experiences with UITS staff and services in my month here."Telephone systems is not conducive to having multiple lines for a department. Very difficult to manage with multiple lines and multiple users (including student workers without dedicated numbers). Help desk doesn't get the best response, sometimes it takes a long time for them to figure out or respond to the issue. I normally do not call unless I have exhausted all my options. When there is an issue that impedes an interviewee on campus or a meeting taking place, it isn't always resolved before the meeting is complete. Help desk wants to do everything over the phone instead of coming to my desk, which is normally a lot quicker, but convincing them is difficult.""Usually, when I send an email to KOHelp, I get a response. However, there are times I send emails to certain individuals and receive no response."

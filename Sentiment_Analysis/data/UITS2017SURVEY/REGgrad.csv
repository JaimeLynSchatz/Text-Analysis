I set up an appointment back in December to have my computer uploaded with all the content it needed for me to be successful in my Master's program. [IRD] and [IRD] were extremely helpful in my computer set up. They both have very positive attitudes, answered all my questions, and provided helpful tips to make me successful.""I received thorough, excellent support services. Find the systems to be easy to access and navigate. Appreciate access to an outstanding internet library. Have not yet used all of the equipment, software, and additional services found on this survey.""So far, all the UITS staff have been very helpful. No concerns at all."They helped me set up my new computer. It was great since I have never owned a laptop until now.The Dual login is not very convenient. And I don't feel like it makes my information any more secure. My phone was stolen and I had no access to my account. That was frustrating. I am very busy and didn't really have the time to deal with that.The only issue I have ever had with technology at IUS is in room 200 of Hillside Hall as the computer and projector have issues working together at times. This has been a problem for two professors that I have had in this room."Seem very knowledge; however, not always the most welcoming office on campus."

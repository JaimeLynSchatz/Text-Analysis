To check the version open your terminal and type: 'python --version' (minus the quotes). If you do not have Python, then you will get an error that your computer does not recognize the command 'python'. If you do you should get something like this: \n",

If you had Python 3 already installed, but not through Anaconda, then you should be ready to go as pip comes pre-installed in Python 3. If you installed Anaconda python, then you will need to open you terminal (Mac) or command prompt (PC) and type 'conda install pip' and this should get pip up and running.  \n",

    "The command ‘pip3’ (without quotes) is used to install Python packages if you did not use Anaconda to install Python. If you installed Anaconda and did the 'conda install pip' step above, then you will use 'pip' (without the 3 or the quotes) to install packages even though you are using Python 3. Again, please note that if you have Anaconda python 3, you use 'pip' and if you acquired Python without Anaconda you use 'pip3'. Now, to install a python package simply open your terminal or command prompt and begin installing Python packages using 'pip' or 'pip3'."

When you enter code and want to see if it works, simply hit “shift” and “return” at the same time and it will run your Python code and spit out any results or errors if there are any. If you have data that takes a while to process  you’ll see a [ * ] in the brackets to the left of the input box while it is processing. When it is done, there will be a number there indicating the frequency of times code in general has been run. These numbers and asterisks do not appear next to markdown text, only your code.\n",

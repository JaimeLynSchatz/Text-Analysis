    "#### Choosing a version of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "First, it is important to determine which version of Python you wish to use. We highly recommend using Python 3, and using the most recent version of Python 3 as the python code we use is all python 3. Mac’s come with 2.7 already installed. The version of 2.7 depends on the version of OS X you are using. To check the version open your terminal and type: 'python --version' (minus the quotes). If it is 2.7.9 or higher, and you wish to stay with python 2 (don't do it!!!), then you should be okay as far as using python 2 goes. A PC will need to have python downloaded from this website (if you insist on 2.7, please download 2.7.13): \n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.python.org/downloads/\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also where you will download Python 3 if you have a Mac and wish to upgrade. As stated above, most of our jupyter notebook examples that are in Python will be using Python 3 code, so it is recommended that you download the latest version of Python 3 if you have little to no experience with Python so you can easily follow along. If using Python 2.7 feels like being wrapped in a warm blanket to you, and you are confident in your abilities to resolve any issues between the two versions, then by all means, keep using Python 2.7 (at your own risk). All our explanations and examples will be for Python 3.\n"

    "#### Pip\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have chosen Python 2.7, despite our warnings, just keep in mind you might need to install the pip command if you chose a version lower than 2.7.9 or your Mac had a version lower than that pre-installed and you do not wish to upgrade. If you chose Python 2.7.9 or higher or Python 3, then you’re good to go as pip is already installed in those versions. Also, if you are using Python 2.7, when you see ‘pip3’ (minus the single quotes) you will simply type ‘pip’ (again, minus the quotes) as the 3 indicates that you are installing the desired package(s) to Python 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "The command ‘pip3’ (or ‘pip’ for you rebels) is used to install Python packages without having to switch over to the Python programming language in your terminal or use an IDE. Simply open your terminal (Mac) or command prompt (PC) and begin installing Python packages."

When you enter code and want to see if it works, simply hit “shift” and “return” at the same time and it will run your Python code and spit out any results or errors if there are any. If you have data that takes a while to process  you’ll see a [ * ] in the brackets to the left of the input box while it is processing. When it is done, there will be a number there indicating the frequency of times code in general has been run. These numbers and asterisks do not appear next to markdown text, only your code.\n",

You can also load them into GitHub.

# About this repo:
Welcome to the Text-Analysis repository for Cyberinfrastructure for Digital Humanities. 

Already familiar with R and/or Python and don't really need any help? Then go ahead and dive right in with our [R](https://github.com/cyberdh/Text-Analysis/tree/master/R/R_scripts) or [Python](https://github.com/cyberdh/Text-Analysis/tree/master/Python/Py_scripts). They have minimal directions and are ready to go.

For those who are new to R and/or Python and need a little assistance, please see our Jupyter Notebooks in both [R notebooks](https://github.com/cyberdh/Text-Analysis/tree/master/R/R_notebooks) and [Python notebooks](https://github.com/cyberdh/Text-Analysis/tree/master/Python/Py_notebooks). These notebooks go into more detail about the code and what it does.

If you are interested in sentiment analysis and ONLY sentiment analysis, then see our Jupyter Notebooks on [sentiment analysis](https://github.com/cyberdh/Text-Analysis/tree/master/Sentiment_Analysis).

#### Please note: The code in this repo is intended for use on Carbonate, the supercomputer at Indiana University, via Research Desktop (RED). Carbonate is a Linux system and uses R version 3.3.1 or 3.4.4 and Python 2.7 or 3.6 and so some of this code may need to be altered if you are using a different version of either R or Python on another computer.

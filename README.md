# About this repo:
Welcome to the Text-Analysis repository for Cyberinfrastructure for Digital Humanities. 

Already familiar with R and don't really need any help? Then go ahead and dive right in with our [R Scripts](https://github.com/cyberdh/Text-Analysis/tree/master/RScripts). They have minimal directions and are ready to go.

For those who are new to R and need a little assistance, please see our [Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/cyberdh/Text-Analysis/tree/master/RNotebooks). These notebooks go into more detail about the code and what it does.

If you are interested in sentiment analysis and ONLY sentiment analysis, then see our Jupyter Notebooks on [sentiment analysis](https://github.com/cyberdh/Text-Analysis/tree/master/PresidentSentiment).

### Please note: The code in this repo is intended for use on Karst, the supercomputer at Indiana University. Karst uses R version 3.3.1 and so some of this code may not work on newer or older versions of R.

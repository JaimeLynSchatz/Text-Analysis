# About this repo:
Welcome to the Text-Analysis repository for Cyberinfrastructure for Digital Humanities. 

Already familiar Python and don't really need any help? Then go ahead and dive right in with our introductory [Python](https://github.com/cyberdh/Text-Analysis/tree/master/Intro/Python/Py_scripts) scripts. They have minimal directions and are ready to go.

For those who are new to Python and need a little assistance, please see our introductory Jupyter Notebooks in [Python notebooks](https://github.com/cyberdh/Text-Analysis/tree/master/Intro/Python/Py_notebooks). These notebooks go into more detail about the code and what it does.

# More Advanced Topics
If you are interested in sentiment analysis and then see our Jupyter Notebooks on [sentiment analysis](https://github.com/cyberdh/Text-Analysis/tree/master/VADERSentimentAnalysis) adapted from VADER (1). 

If your are interested in topic modeling, then find our notebooks on [LDA](https://github.com/cyberdh/Text-Analysis/tree/master/TopicModeling/LDA), [LSA](https://github.com/cyberdh/Text-Analysis/tree/master/TopicModeling/LSA), and [word vectors](https://github.com/cyberdh/Text-Analysis/tree/master/TopicModeling/Word2Vec).

#### Please note: The code in this repo is set up for use on Carbonate, the supercomputer at Indiana University, via Research Desktop (RED). Carbonate is a Linux system and uses R version 3.3.1 or 3.4.4 and Python 2.7 or 3.6 and so some of this code may need to be altered if you are using a different version of either R or Python on another computer. The Python code in this repo is all Python 3.

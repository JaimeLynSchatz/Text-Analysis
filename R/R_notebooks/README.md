The R_notebooks exist as tutorials to lead you through the scripts found in the R_scripts section of Text-Analysis. The R_notebooks use the same code as the scripts, but provide extensive explanation for the scripts as well as example outputs.

=========================

HOW TO USE:

For quick access to the R_notebooks, click on the .ipynb version of the script in which you are interested. The .ipynb will open in the same Github window you currently have open. You can also download this for reference.

If you would like to view the R_notebooks in a Jupyter Notebook, download the .ipynb files and open them in Jupyter Notebook. Jupyter Notebook is already installed and ready to go on Research Desktop (ReD) which runs on Carbonate. If you are running these notebooks on your own computer, you will need two things. First, make sure you have Jupyter Notebook installed. We have instructions on how to do that here: https://github.com/cyberdh/Text-Analysis/blob/master/installJupyterMacPC.ipynb

Second, you will need to install the R kernel so that Jupyter Notebook can run R code. We have instructions on how to do that here: https://github.com/cyberdh/Text-Analysis/blob/master/installRkernelInJupyter.ipynb

Jupyter Notebook automatically displays all the files and folders in your home directory (which is your Carbonate directory under your username on Carbonate and varies on a Mac or PC), so make sure you save the repository in your home directory. Open the Text-Analysis folder and then open the R folder and then the R_notebooks folder and choose the .ipynb file of your choice.

=========================

#### Please note: The code in this repo is intended for use on ReD and therefore Carbonate, the supercomputer at Indiana University. Carbonate is a Linux system and uses R version 3.3.1 and 3.4.4 and so some of this code may need to be altered if you are using a different version on another computer.

    "\n",
    "Since we will be using Carbonate as the example for our file paths and other elements in the scripts and Jupyter notebooks, many of you may want to save these files to Carbonate to make following along a bit easier. To do this you will need a Carbonate account if you do not already have one. Indiana University students, faculty, staff, and sponsored affiliates can request a Carbonate account. Steps on how to do so can be found [here](https://kb.iu.edu/d/aolp). Once you have your account, you'll want to be able to access the [Research Desktop (RED)](https://kb.iu.edu/d/apum). You will also need to have access to RED through the [thinlinc client](https://kb.iu.edu/d/aput). Once you have your account and can access it, you'll want to acquire the [Cyber DH Box Text-Analysis](https://iu.box.com/v/Text-Analysis) repository and save it to Carbonate via Research Desktop. Or download it to Carbonate from our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/cyberdh/Text-Analysis). Whichever option you use, it will download as a .zip file so you will need to double click the .zip file to extract the repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "The nice thing about RED is that it comes with a built in way for you to access your Box account so you can download the repository to Box and use the Text-Analysis notebooks and scripts on Carbonate and your own computer without having to use an SFTP client or some other means of moving files back and forth.\n",

Then just go to Text-Analysis > R > RNotebooks and choose the notebook you wish to use, it should open up in Jupyter Notebook.\n",

Since some kinds of objects prohibit certain actions, a simple way to check the type of object you are currently working with is class().

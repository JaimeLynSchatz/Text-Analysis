## Wordcloud of Top 100 Words in tweets using the keyword "pulse"

Using 5000 tweets with the hashtag #pulse from June 16, 2016, we will create a wordcloud of the top words used to describe the tragedy.

***
### Global parameters 

In your terminal or command prompt, launch R by typing "R" (without quotes) and pressing Enter. Next, set the working directory by pointing to the location on your computer where you have stored the files. Below, we have chosen to Save the folder "Text-Analysis" in the Cyber DH account on the Karst super-computer here at Indiana University. It contains the R scripts, texts, notebooks, and results. If you have cloned the Github repository, simply point to where you have saved the folder. If you save it to your personal Karst folder, it will most likely look very similar to the example below. You start in the "N" or "gpfs" directory, either one will work and the default directory Karst starts you in seems to vary by user. We will be using "N" in our examples. From here you go to the "home" directory, and this is true for "N" or "gpfs." Now you find the first letter of your username, and using cyberdh as an example, we go to "c" (and yes the case of the letters matter as "N" is different than "n"). Then we look for the second letter in the username, which is "y" for our purposes here. Then you find your full username, which for us is "cyberdh" and then you should see a folder named "Karst". This is where the similarities might end as it now depends on where you saved your "Text-Analysis" folder. The final path should look similar to this: "/N/home/x/x/xxxxxxx/Karst/Text-Analysis" (with the quotes now). Alternatively, if you are on a PC, you will need to use an absolute path such as "C:/Users/XXX" (with the quotes again). If you decide to save it to a Mac you can use a relative path such as "~/Desktop/XXX" (also with the quotes again).

OR

If you are using RStudio, click Session in the menu bar > Set Working Directory > Choose Directory, then select the Text-Analysis directory in which you are working. This will set your working directory in the console pane, but make sure to copy the path into the source pane above to keep the directory constant if you close this script and reopen later.

HINT: Your working directory is the folder from which you will be pulling your data.

```{r}
setwd("/N/home/c/y/cyberdh/Text-Analysis/")
```

#### Include necessary packages for notebook 

R's extensibility comes in large part from packages. Packages are groups of functions, data, and algorithms that allow users to easily carry out processes without recreating the wheel. Some packages are included in the basic installation of R, others created by R users are available for download. Make sure to have the following packages installed before beginning so that they can be accessed while running the scripts.

OR

If you are using RStudio, packages can be installed by navigating to Tools in the menu bar > Install Packages.

```{r}
library(knitr)
library(markdown)
library(rmarkdown)
library(wordcloud)
library(tm)
library(RColorBrewer)
```

Load data (this time a curated set of tweets grabbed using the twitterR library and API authentication, then saved with the .RData extension)

```{r}
load(file = "data/twitter/pulse2016-06-16.RData")
```

###Prepare text data

While it seems logical to use tm (text mining package) again to create our wordcloud, there is a bug in the library that causes it to fail with this kind of data when run on a mac. Instead, we will take the opportunity to process the data in a different way.

First we are going to take the list of 5000 tweets created when we grabbed the file above and convert it into a character vector, grabbing only the text. The "sapply" function to traverse the list "tweets" applying a function "x" which grabs the text. 

```{r}
tweets_text <- sapply(tweets, function(x) x$text)
```

Let's look at the first few tweets:

```{r}
head(tweets_text)
```
Now we need to turn the character vector into a corpus:
```{r}
corpus <- Corpus(VectorSource(tweets_text))
```
Next, we need to convert the text to UTF-8 as sometimes the program has difficulty reading the characters:
```{r}
corpus <- tm_map(corpus,
                 content_transformer(function(x) iconv(x, to='UTF-8', sub='byte')),
                 mc.cores=1)
```
Now we need to convert all the text to lower case, so that "Clinton" and "clinton" are not seen as seperate words.
```{r}
corpus <- tm_map(corpus, content_transformer(tolower))
```
Now we need to remove all punctuation so that only alphanumeric characters are read:
```{r}
corpus <- tm_map(corpus, content_transformer(removePunctuation))
```
You may also wish to eliminate numbers, especially if they skew your results any, however, numbers may also be important, so that is why this one is optional:
```{r}
corpus <- tm_map(corpus, content_transformer(removeNumbers))
```

It's time to remove stopwords. In our plain text wordcloud, we used tm's options for a wordlist and will be doing the same again. Concatenated onto the list are common twitter words not yet eliminated such at "rt" (retweet), "amp" (&), and our search term "pulse."

```{r}
corpus <- tm_map(corpus, content_transformer(removeWords), c(stopwords("english"), 'rt', 'amp', 'pulse', 'https', 'marketing'))
```

Plot the wordcloud! There are a number of arguments you can customize: "scale"" indicates the size of the words; "max.words" controls how many words show up in the wordcloud; and we've used the library "RColorBrewer" to give us access to some predefined palettes. Note that if you change the palette, you need to tell the argument how many colors are in the new palette. 

```{r}
wordcloud(corpus, min.freq=10, max.words=100, scale=c(4,1), colors=brewer.pal(8, "Dark2"))
```

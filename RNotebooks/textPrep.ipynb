Other commands can be used throughout the programming process to check on your algorithm and make sure everything looks the way you think it should. Learning the following commands will give you a brief introduction to R while also setting you up with a solid toolkit to begin programming.\n"

    "### Loading files from Github to Karst\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we will be using Karst as the example for our file paths and other elements in these R notebooks, many of you may want to save these files to Karst to make following along a bit easier. To do this you will need a Karst account if you do not already have one. Indiana University students, faculty, staff, and sponsored affiliates can request a Karst account. Steps on how to do so can be found [here](https://kb.iu.edu/d/bezu#account). Once you have your account, you'll want to acquire the Text-Analysis repository and save it to Karst. Information on how to access your Karst account can be found [here](https://kb.iu.edu/d/bezu#access). \n",
    "\n",
    "A slightly more complex way in the short term, but easier in the long run, is to create a Project in R Studio and use Version Control to connect to the Cyber DH GitHub Text-Analysis repository. To do this you will need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/), and be signed in to [R Studio on Karst](https://rstudio.iu.edu/auth-sign-in) using yur IU username and passphrase. Now go to your GitHub account and make sure you are signed in there as well. Then go to [https://github.com/cyberdh/Text-Analysis](https://github.com/cyberdh/Text-Analysis) and click on the \"Fork\" button in the upper right hand corner. This will now give you an exact copy of the Text-Analysis repository in your GitHub so you can make changes without changing our Cyber DH master. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now go back to R Studio and go to \"Tools\" in the menu and choose \"Global Opitions.\" Then in the resulting pop-up box choose \"Git/SVN.\" Then click on the button that says \"Create RSA Key...\" and copy (ctrl + A and then ctrl + C) all of the resulting text. Now go to your GitHib account and click on the little dropdown arrow next to your profile picture/avatar and choose \"Settings.\"\" Then choose \"SSH and GPG keys\" in the menu on the left. Now, click the \"New SSH key\" button. Put something descriptive in the title box like \"Karst R Studio\" and then paste the copied RSA Key from R Studio in the \"Key\" box and click the \"Add SSH key\" button. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now go back to R Studio and click on the drop down arrow in the upper right hand corner of R Studio that should say \"Project (None)\" at the moment. When you click on the arrow a bunch of options should appear, Choose \"New Project.\" The resulting options should say \"New Directory,\" \"Existing Directory,\" and \"Version Control.\" Click on \"Version Control.\" Now it will ask you to choose between \"Git\" or \"SVN.\" Click on \"Git.\" The next pop up should be asking for a Repository URL and a directory name. To get the URL from your forked Text-Analysis repository go to your GitHub account and look for the Text-Analysis repository. There should be a green button that says \"Clone or download.\" Click that button. You have the option to clone with HTTPS or SSH, choose SSH and click the clipboard with the arrow to copy the URL. Paste the copied URL into the URL box. It should look like this: git@github.com:your-username/Text-Analysis.git and then make sure the Directory name is Text-Analysis with the dash and the capitalization just as it is typed in this sentence. Otherwise you will have to change the directory everytime you try to run the scripts in R Studio. Now also make sure that you have R version 3.1.1 chosen in the lower left corner. This is currently the most stable build of R Studio on Karst. Now click the \"Create Project\" button. If you did everything as described here you should see \"Text-Analysis\" where it used to say \"Project (None)\" and \"R 3.1.1\" directly to the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you also have the Cyber DH Text-Analysis repository saved to Karst and accessible through R Studio on Karst. The benefit to this way of doing it is that you can now pull the repository from GitHub whenever you want and you will not have us constantly changing the code you have tweeked for your own project. However, if you have not really changed the code, but notice we have made significant changes to ours and want those changes, you can update your fork by following the directions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/). Forking and then pushing changes made in R Studio to your forked repository on GitHub allows you to make changes and have those changes saved in two seperate places (which is always a good idea), but you can also make changes and wait a while before pushing them to your forked Text-Analysis repository."

    "These R Notebooks are actually .ipynb files, which mean they run in Jupyter Notebook and you will need to run them in a Jupyter Notebook. Luckily, on Karst Desktop there is a Jupyter Notebook icon. Click on 'Applications' in the top left corner, then choose Analytics, and finally click on Jupyter Notebook. When Jupyer Notebook opens you should see a list of files and folders on the left hand side. One of these should say Text-Analysis (if you correctly pulled from our Text-Analysis repo). Then just go to Text-Analysis > RNotebook and choose the notebook you wish to run. If you are planning to run these notebooks on your personal computer, you will first need to make sure you have Jupyter Notebook installed, and we have instructions on that [here](https://github.com/cyberdh/Text-Analysis/blob/master/installJupyterMacPC.ipynb). Second you will need to make sure you have the R kernel for Jupyter Notebook installed so that the notebook can access your version of R to run the R code in the notebooks. We have instructions on that [here](https://github.com/cyberdh/Text-Analysis/blob/master/installRkernelInJupyter.ipynb)."

Since some kinds of objects prohibit certain actions, a simple way to check the type of object you are currently working with is class().

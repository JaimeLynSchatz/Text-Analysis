The RNotebooks exist as tutorials to lead you through the scripts found in the other section of Text Analysis. The RNotebooks use the same code as the scripts, but provide extensive explanation for the scripts as well as example outputs.

=========================

HOW TO USE:

For quick access to the RNotebooks, click on the PDF version of the script in which you are interested. The PDF will open in the same Github window you currently have open. You can also download this for reference.

If you would like to view the RNotebooks in RStudio or as an HTML webpage, download the RMarkdown files and open them in RStudio. Along the toolbar below the file tabs, you will see a ball of yarn icon with “Knit [format]” and down arrow. Click the down arrow and choose your preferred output for the RNotebook. Be patient while the Notebook knits and it will either pop up in a new window or in the RStudio Viewer (you can change the output if you prefer). 

Note: You can view the RMarkdown files in Github (similar to the PDF files), but this format does NOT show code or plot outputs. To see the plots, either view the PDF or download the RMarkdown and knit in RStudio.

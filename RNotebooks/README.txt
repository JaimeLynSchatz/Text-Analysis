The RNotebooks exist as tutorials to lead you through the scripts found in the other section of Text Analysis. The RNotebooks use the same code as the scripts, but provide extensive explanation for the scripts as well as example outputs.

=========================

HOW TO USE:

For quick access to the RNotebooks, click on the .ipynb version of the script in which you are interested. The .ipynb will open in the same Github window you currently have open. You can also download this for reference.

If you would like to view the RNotebooks in a Jupyter Notebook, download the .ipynb files and open them in Jupyter Notebook. Jupyter Notebook automatically displays all the files and folders in your home directory, so make sure you save the repository in your home directory. Open the Text-Analysis folder and then open the RNotebooks folder and choose the .ipynb file of your choice. 

Note: You can view the Markdown files in Github (similar to the .ipynb files), but this format does NOT run in Jupyter Notebook.

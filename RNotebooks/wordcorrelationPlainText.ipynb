Once you have your Karst account simply go to [rstudio.iu.edu](https://rstudio.iu.edu/auth-sign-in) and login using your IU username and passphrase.  Next, set the working directory by pointing to the location on Karst where you have stored the files. Below, we have chosen to save the folder \"Text-Analysis\" as a \"Project\" in R Studio on the Karst super-computer here at Indiana University. It contains the R scripts, texts, notebooks, and results. If you have forked and cloned the Github repository (see [textPrep.Rmd](textPrep.Rmd) for directions on how), simply point to where you have saved the folder. If you save it to your personal Karst folder, it will most likely look very similar to the example below. Karst is a unix server and so the home directory is represented by a ~ and, thus, the path will look like this \"~/Text-Analysis/\" (with the quotes). Alternatively, if you are on a PC, you will need to use an absolute path such as \"C:/Users/XXX\" (with the quotes again).\n",

This helps eliminate sparse terms that appeare to correlate when in reality they do not. An example being the word \"squirrel\" appears to correlate with the word \"love\" in Shakespeare's plays at a .69 rate. Well, Shakespeare only uses the word \"squirrel\" three times, and \"love\" appears in all three plays as well, and using pearson's correlation coefficient they appear to have a .69 correlation. While this might be true, given the sparsity of the term squirrel, it does not help us understand Shakespeare's use of the word \"love.\" Basically, by removing sparse terms we eliminate these less useful correlations. The 0.4 eliminates terms that appear 0 times in 40% of the documents. So the higher your percentage, the fewer terms are removed. If you choose 0.8, you are removing terms that appear 0 times in 80% of the documents, which means the term only needs to appear 1 time in 20% of the documents to remain in the dtms.   "

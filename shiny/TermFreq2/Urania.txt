THE COVNTESSE OF MOVNTGOME|RIES VRANIA. THE FIRST BOOKE.
WHen the Spring began to appeare like the welcome mes|senger of Summer, one sweet (and in that more sweet) morning, after Aurora had called all carefull eyes to attend the day, forth came the faire Shepherdesse Vra|nia, (faire indeed; yet that farre too meane a title for her, who for beautie deseru'd the highest stile could be giuen by best knowing Iudgements). Into the Meade she came, where vsually shee draue her flocks to feede, whose leaping and wantonnesse shewed they were proud of such a Guide: But she, whose sad thoughts led her to another manner of spending her time, made her soone leaue them, and follow her late begun custome; which was (while they delighted themselues) to sit vnder some shade, bewailing her misfortune; while they fed, to feed vpon her owne sorrow and teares, which at this time she began againe to summon, sitting downe vnder the shade of a well-spread Beech; the ground (then[...]blest) and the tree with full, and fine leaued branches, growing proud to beare, and shadow such perfections. But she regarding nothing, in comparison of her woe, thus proceeded in her griefe: Alas Vrania, said she, (the true seruant to misfortune); of any mise|rie that can befall woman, is not this the most and greatest which thou art falne into? Can there be any neare the vnhappinesse of being ignorant, and that in the highest kind, not being certaine of mine owne estate or birth? Why was I not stil continued in the beleefe I was, as I appeare, a Shepherdes, [...]nd Daughter to a Shepherd? My ambition then went no higher then this [...]state, now flies it to a knowledge; then was I contented, now perplexed. O ignorance, can thy dulnesse yet procure so sharpe a paine? and that such a thought as makes me now aspire vnto knowledge? How did I ioy in this poore life being quiet? blest in the loue of those I tooke for parents, but now by them I know the contrary, and by that knowledge, not to know my selfe. Miserable Vrania, worse art thou now then these thy Lambs; for they know their dams, while thou dost liue vnknowne of any. By this we[...]e others come into that Meade with their flocks: but shee esteeming her so[...]owing thoughts her best, and choycest companie, left that place, taking a little path 2 which brought her to the further side of the plaine, to the foote of the rocks, speaking as she went these lines, her eies fixt vpon the ground, her very soule turn'd into mourning.


VNseene, vnknowne, I here alone complaine 
To Rocks, to Hills, to Meadowes, and to Springs, 
Which can no helpe returne to ease my paine, 
But back my sorrowes the sad Eccho brings. 
Thus still encreasing are my woes to me, 
Doubly resounded by that monefull voice, 
Which seemes to second me in miserie, 
And answere giues like friend of mine owne choice. 
Thus onely she doth my companion proue, 
The others silently doe offer ease: 
But those that grieue, a grieuing note doe loue; 
Pleasures to dying eies bring but disease: 
And such am I, who daily ending liue, 
Wayling a state which can no comfort giue. 
In this passion she went on, till she came to the foote of a great rocke, shee thinking of nothing lesse then ease, sought how she might ascend it; hoping there to passe away her time more peaceably with lonelinesse, though not to find least respit from her sorrow, which so deerely she did value, as by no meanes she would impart it to any. The way was hard, though by some win|dings making the ascent pleasing. Hauing attained the top, she saw vnder some hollow trees the entrie into the rocke: she fearing nothing but the con|tinuance of her ignorance, went in; where shee found a pretty roome, as if that stonie place had yet in pitie, giuen leaue for such perfections to come in|to the heart as chiefest, and most beloued place, because most louing. The place was not vnlike the ancient (or the descriptions of ancient) Hermitages, instead of hangings, couered and lined with Iuie, disdaining ought els should come there, that being in such perfection. This richnesse in Natures plentie made her stay to behold it, and almost grudge the pleasant fulnes of content that place might haue, if sensible, while she must know to taste of torments. As she was thus in passion mixt with paine, throwing her eies as wildly as timerous Louers do for feare of discouerie, she perceiued a little Light, and such a one, as a chinke doth oft discouer to our sights. She curious to see what this was, with her delicate hands put the naturall ornament aside, dis|cerning a little doore, which she putting from her, passed through it into ano|ther roome, like the first in all proportion; but in the midst there was a square stone, like to a prettie table, and on it a wax-candle burning; and by that a paper, which had suffered it selfe patiently to receiue the discouering of so much of it, as presented this Sonnet (as it seemed newly written) to her sight.



HEre all alone in silence might I mourne: 
But how can silence be where sorrowes flow? 
Sigh's with complaints haue poorer paines out-worne; 
But broken hearts can only true griefe show. 


3 
Drops of my dearest bloud shall let Loue know 
Such teares for her I shed, yet still do burne, 
As no spring can quench least part of my woe, 
Till this liue earth, againe to earth doe turne. 



Hatefull all thought of comfort is to me, 
Despised day, let me still night possesse; 
Let me all torment[...]s feele in their excesse, 
And but this light allow my state to [...] 



Which still doth wast, and wasting as this light, 
Are my sad dayes vnto eternall night. 


Alas Vrania (sigh'd she)! How well doe these words, this place, and all a|gree with thy fortune? sure poore soule thou wert heere appointed to spend thy daies, and these roomes ordain'd to keepe thy tortures in; none being assu|redly so matchlesly vnfortunate. Turning from the table, she discerned in the roome a bed of boughes, and on it a man lying, depriued of outward sense, as she thought, and of life, as she at first did feare, which strake her into a great amazement: yet hauing a braue spirit, though shadowed vnder a meane ha|bit, she stept vnto him, whom she found not dead, but laid vpon his back, his head a little to her wards, his armes foulded on his brest, haire long, and beard disordered, manifesting all care; but care it selfe had left him: curiousnesse thus farre affoorded him, as to bee perfectly discerned the most exact peece of miserie; Apparrell hee had sutable to the habitation, which was a long gray robe. This grieuefull spectacle did much amaze the sweet and tender-hearted Shepherdesse; especially, when she perceiued (as she might by the helpe of the candle) the teares which distilled from his eyes; who seeming the image of death, yet had this signe of worldly sorrow, the drops falling in that abundance, as if there were a kind strife among them, to rid their Master first of that burdenous carriage; or else meaning to make a floud, and so drowne their wofull Patient in his owne sorrow, who yet lay still, but then fetching a deepe groane from the profoundest part of his soule, he said. Miserable Perissus, canst thou thus liue, knowing she that gaue thee life is gone? Gone, O me! and with her all my ioy departed. Wilt thou (vnblessed creature) lie here com|plaining for her death, and know she died for thee? Let truth and shame make thee doe something worthy of such a Loue, ending thy daies like thy selfe, and one fit to be her Seruant. But that I must not doe: then thus remaine and foster stormes, still to torment thy wretched soule withall, since all are little, and too too little for such a losse. O deere Li|mena, louing Limena, worthy Limena, and more rare, constant Limena: perfections delicately faign'd to be in women were verified in thee, was such worthinesse framed onely to be wondred at by the best, but giuen as a prey to base and vnworthy iealousie? When were all worthy parts ioyn'd in one, but in thee (my best Limena)? yet all these growne sub|iect to a creature ignorant of all but ill, like vnto a Foole, who in a darke Caue, that hath but one way to get out, hauing a candle, but not the 4 vnderstanding what good it doth him, puts it out: this ignorant wretch not being able to comprehend thy vertues, did so by thee in thy mur|der, putting out the worlds light, and mens admiration: Limena, Limena, O my Limena. With that he fell from complaining into such a passion, as weeping and crying were neuer in so wofull a perfection, as now in him; which brought as deserued a compassion from the excellent Shep|herdesse, who already had her heart so tempered with griefe, as that it was apt to take any impression that it would come to seale withall. Yet taking a braue courage to her, shee stept vnto him, kneeling downe by his side, and gently pulling him by the arme, she thus spake. Sir (said she) hauing heard some part of your sorrowes, they haue not only made me truly pitie you, but wonder at you; since if you haue lost so great a treasure, you should not lie thus leauing her and your loue vnreuenged, suffering her murderers to liue, while you lie here complaining; and if such perfections be dead in her, why make you not the Phoenix of your deeds liue againe, as to new life rais'd out of the reuenge you should take on them? then were her end satisfied, and you deseruedly accounted wor|thie of her fauour, if shee were so worthie as you say. If shee were? O God (cri'd out Perissus), what diuelish spirit art thou, that thus dost come to torture me? But now I see you are a woman; and therefore not much to be marked, and lesse resisted: but if you know charitie, I pray now practise it, and leaue me who am afflicted sufficiently with|out your companie; or if you will stay, discourse not to me. Neither of these will I doe (said she). If you be then (said he) some furie of pur|pose sent to vex me, vse your force to the vttermost in martyring me; for neuer was there a fitter subiect, then the heart of poore Perissus is. I am no furie (repli'd the diuine Vrania), nor hither come to trouble you, but by accident lighted on this place; my cruell hap being such, as one|ly the like can giue me content, while the solitarinesse of this like caue might giue me quiet, though not ease, seeking for such a one, I happe|ned hither; and this is the true cause of my being here, though now I would vse it to a better end if I might. Wherefore fauour me with the knowledge of your griefe; which heard, it may be I shall giue you some counsell, and comfort in your sorrow. Cursed may I bee (cri'd he) if euer I take comfort, hauing such cause of mourning: but because you are, or seeme to be afflicted, I will not refuse to satisfie your demaund, but tell you the saddest storie that euer was rehearsed by dying man to liuing wo|man, and such a one, as I feare will fasten too much sadnesse in you; yet should I denie it, I were too blame, being so well knowne to these sense|lesse places; as were they sensible of sorrow, they would condole, or else amased at such crueltie, stand dumbe as they doe, to find that man should be so inhumane.
Then faire Shepherdesse, heare my selfe say my name is Perissus, Ne|phew I am to the King of Sicilie, a place fruitfull and plentifull of all things, onely niggardly of good nature to a great man in that Country, whom I am sure you haue heard me blame in my complaints. Heire I am as yet to this King mine Vncle; and truly may I say so, for a more vnfortunate Prince neuer liued, so as I inherit his crosses, howsoeuer I 5 shall his estate. There was in this Country (as the only blessing it en|ioyed) a Lady, or rather a Goddesse for incomparable beautie, and ma[...]ch|les vertues, called Limena, daughter to a Duke, but Princesse of all hear[...]s: this starre comming to the Court to honour it with such light, it was in that my blessed destinie to see her, and be made her seruant, or better to say, a slaue to her perfections; thus long was I happie, but now begins the tragedie: for warres falling out betweene the people and the Gen|tlemen, the King was by the people (imagining he tooke the other part) brought into some danger, and so great an one, as rudenes ioynd with ill nature could bring him into, being at last besieged in a strong hold of his, all of vs his seruants, and gentle subiects, striuing for his good and safetie; in this time nothing appearing but danger, and but wise force to preserue mens liues and estates vnto them, euery one taking the best meanes to attaine vnto their good desires. The Duke (father to the best, and truest beauty) would yet bestow that vpon a great Lord in the Country, truly for powerfull command and meanes, a fit match for any, but the wonder of women, since none could without much flatterie to him|selfe, thinke he might aspire to the blessing of being accounted worthie to be her seruant, much lesse her husband. Shee seeing it was her fa|thers will, esteeming obedience beyond all passions, how worthily [...]o|euer suffered, most dutifully, though vnwillingly, said, she would obey; her tongue faintly deliuering, what her heart so much detested; loathing almost it selfe, for consenting in shew to that which was most contrarie to it selfe; yet thus it was concluded, and with as much speed as any man would make to an eternall happines. While of this, and so my mis|fortune, I remained ignorant, till one day the warres being a little cea|sed, though not ended, the siege still continuing, I stole from mine vn|cle to see my heart, which she kept safe with her: but when I came thi|ther, I found, or fear'd I found no roome for it. She who had it, being in the power of mine enemie (for so I accounted him, when he enioyed my losse, my hopes being frustrate, my ioyes lost and spoild, I grew from my selfe, my sences failed me, a trembling possessing my whole bodie, so as this distemper was marked, and pittied of all: but what did comfort me, was, that she did seeme to pitty me. Then did I blesse my torments, that had procured me such a fauour. There were none, but carefully sought my health, especially her husband, whose diligence was as tedious, as his wiues was my onely ioy. Grieu'd I was to stay and see my miserie, yet sad I was to goe from seeing her, who gaue me (though a barr'd) delight in beholding her: but knowing passion the greater Lord ouer my strength, I tooke my leaue, pretending busines, hauing onely taken the opportuni|tie that way afforded me to visite them, passing so neare by them; they all seemed sorry for my going, and Limena indeed was so; then by vn|us'd pathes I got backe to the King, often, as I rode, looking to that place where I left my soule prisoner. When I had been a while at home, remembring, or rather neuer letting the beautie of Limena be absent from me, I say remembring her, and my euerlasting wretched state in missing h[...]r; calling my mischiefe by his gaine to account, I found so much cause to lament, as in short time I was but mournefull sorrow; my friends 6 grieu'd, and generally all did shew displeasure for me, only my selfe found nothing but cause to proceed in this dispaire, loue hauing truly changed me to that most low, and still vnluckie fate. Businesse of State I neg|lected, going about as in a dreame, led by the cruellest of hellish spirits, Despaire, till I was awaked by a command to goe and leade some troops which were gathered by the Kings friends together comming to raise the siege, yet desiring me to be their head. I went, and thus farre wil|lingly, hauing so much hope left me, as to thinke I might by this meanes conclude my afflictions with my end; yet first I resolued to write vnto her, that she might know, she had so vnblest a creature to her Seruant. When I had written my letter with shaking hands, and yet a more sha|king heart, I gaue it to a Page of mine, who was newly come vnto mee, and neuer had been seene in her Fathers house, giuing him besides directions how to carrie himselfe, which he discreetly did obserue, and found as fit an opportunitie as could be wisht: for her husband being gone to see an anci|ent house of his, she walked alone into a little Groue below the place of her abiding; he perceiuing her, knew straight it was she; wherefore he followed her, hauing before hid himselfe in the vppermost part of the thicket, expect|ing occasion whereby to performe his Masters commaund. He then seeing it offered, would not neglect it, though somewhat timerously, esteeming her for her excellencies rather some Goddesse of those Woods, then an earthly Creature: but remembring the infinite (yet not sufficient) praises I had gi|uen her, concluded, it could be none other then Limena; so as comming to her, he on his knees deliuered the letter, saying these words; The wofull Pe|rissus his Lord and Master presented that, with his seruice to her. This (though but little) was more then I could haue said, if in his place: For Lord, how was I afflicted with millions of doubts how it might be deliue|red; then, whether she would accept of it; and most, what she would conceiue of my boldnesse, quaking when I gaue it him, knowing how wretched a crea|ture I must bee, if it offended her, yet wishing I might haue had the papers place once more to haue been toucht by her, though, if it brought dislike, for that to haue suffered martyrdome. But she for my happinesse tooke it, and with a pretty blush read it, which since I perceiu'd did spring from loue, yet blusht to see it selfe so liuely in her cheekes. When she had read it, Good youth (said she) commend me to your Lord: but for his letter, say, It needs no answer till he come himselfe, and fetch one. With this he return'd, and so with much comfort to me, hope being glad to build on any small ground, how much more then on so likely a possibility. I then, Hopes seruant, as be|fore onely slaue to Despaire, made all haste I could to see her, hauing good and welcome meanes affoorded me, being able with conuenience to take her F[...]thers house in my way to the new-rais'd Army. Thither I came, which though in a wild Forest, yet it was pretended, I left the great roads for my better safetie. Thus was a colour set vpon my loue, which but for her ser|uice, and so the safelier to serue her, would suffer any glosse but truth in affe|ction. Being there ariu'd, I was extreamely welcomed of all: her Father, a graue and wise man, discoursed with mee of businesse of State: after him, and so all supper time, her husband discoursed of hunting, an exercise fit for such a creature. Neither of these brought my Mistris from a graue, and al|most 7 sad co[...]ntenance, which made me somewhat feare, knowing her vnder|standing, and experience, able and sufficient to iudge, or aduise in any matter we could discourse of: but modestie in her caus'd it, onely louing know|ledge, to be able to discerne mens vnderstandings by their arguments, but no way to shew it by her owne speech. This (and withall feare of discouering some passions, which she, though excelling in wit and iudgement; yet could not gouerne, at least, guiltines forc'd her to thinke so) was the reason [...]he held her grauitie; yet after she grew more merry. And I finding a fit time by her husbands going out of the chamber, with some companie that was there, humbly desired an answere of my letter. She blushing, and as if ashamed so much innocent vertue should be discouered with my Louer-like importuni|tie in her, though strong in constancie; yet womans affection gain'd so much by lookes, and sweet though-fearing words, as I was resolued, and assured of her loue, which made me proud of such a treasure, begin to dispose part of it to my benefit, for looking about, and seeing euery ones eyes carried their owne waies, I kist her; she, not offended, yet said; Let not my freedome make you dispose otherwise then virtuously of me: I vowed more then that liber|tie I would not aske, which I know, if I had offered, her vertue would haue refused, nor truly would my deere and worthy affection permit mee to de|maund, and this held our loues more firme, when tied by vertue. But not to hold you long with this (which yet to me is some ease for the present, al|though the bitterer the conclusion is that followes). We had as many such meetings as true, or fained meanes could compasse vs, [...]till our miserie was such, as this wild man her husband (whether out of true consideration of his great vnworthines, or proceeding from his froward disposition, I know not) grew iealous (an humour following base minds as readily, as thunder doth the lightning), then had he rashnes to accompany the other, which fram'd a determinatio~, which was soone altered fro~ that name by performance, that she should stay no longer with her father, but go with him to his own house; this I had notice of, but all that we could doe, could not hinder the accom|plishing his will, and saue her honour, which to me, more deere then mine owne life was esteemed. But the night before her going I came thither, where I found the accustomed entertainement, he vsing me with al shew of respect, which in that kind I embraced; our hearts being as farre from meaning truth in giuing or accepting, as truth is from bare complement, but greatnesse in me made him vse it; and care in me (of my better selfe) receiue it; my heart swelling with hate and scorne, euen almost to breaking, when I did see him. That night I saw her, and but spake to her, so curiously her husband watched vs, yet could he not keepe our eies, but by them we did deliuer our soules, he onely able to keepe her daintie body in his wicked prison. The next day they went, and so went all worth with this odd man to haue her delicacy kept like a Diamond in a rotten box: yet she considering it to be to no pur|pose to contend, where she was miserably bound to obey, obserued him, as well as she could bring her spirit to consent to; yet did he begin for her wel|come to grow curst to her; with her Seruants he first began, finding, or bet|ter to say, framing occasions to be rid of them all, placing of his owne about her, which she suffered, onely contenting her selfe with the memorie of our Loues: yet wanting the true content which was in our conuersation, shee 8 grew sad, and keeping much within, grew pale, her rosie cheekes and lippes changing to wannesse: but this was all the change, her noble heart free from such a sinne. This was but part of her affliction, still vexing her sweete disposition, with speaking slightly of me, and then telling her of her loue to me; which brought her to that passe, as at last I was not named, but she would blush; then would he reuile her, and vilely vse her: but she patiently, and si|lently bare all, not suffering me to haue notice of it, lest it might, as it should haue done, moue mee to reuenge her wrong for my sake endured. Thus it rested, she restlesly bearing all the ills that froward Nature (mixt with pee|uish and spitefull iealousie) could afflict vpon the purest mind; vsing no o|ther meanes, but gentle and mild perswasions, which wrought no more in him, but that still his madnesse increased. Now was his house not farre from the way which I must passe betweene the Campe, and the great Citie of Si|racusa, being one of the chiefe of that kingdome; and which at that time had yeelded it selfe againe vnto the King. I hearing Philargus (for so was this vnwor[...]hie man called) was at his house, with his truly vertuous wife, whom my soule longed to see, I resolued to lodge there that night, not (alas) mis|trusting the misfortune, but coueting to see her, whom more then my heart I loued, or lou'd my heart the better for being hers. So I went thither, where I was by him exceedingly well welcom'd in outward shew, though his mea|ning was contrary, which I should haue found, had his diuelish plots bin rea|die, Iealousie hauing now blinded him to all good nature or iudgement. She poore Lady (poore onely in this fortune) sad and grieu'd, all her smiles turn'd into sighes, and thinkings, which made me feare, and wonder, wondring at the change of her beauty, which yet in p[...]lenes shew'd excellency; and feare I did, lest my absence had offe~ded her[...] but I was deceiu'd, while I lest thought of the true cause, or could imagine such villanie plotted against so rare per|fections. Desirous to know the cause, I remain'd almost impatient, not ventu|ring to speake to her before her husba[...]d, for hurting her: but he going out of the roome, after wee had supped, either to couer the flames which were ready to breake out in huge fires of his mistrust, or to haue the company fit|ter for him, aff[...]cting stil to be chiefe; his absence, howsoeuer, gaue me oppor|tunitie to demaund the reason of her strangenesse: She sigh'd to heare mee call it so, and with teares told me the reason, concluding; and thus doe you see my Lord (said she) the torments I suffer for your loue; yet do you more torture me with doubting me, who haue no happines left me, but the know|ledge of my faith to you, all afflictions being welcome to me, which for your sake I suffer. Betweene rage and paine I remain'd amazed, till shee, ta|king mee by the hand, brought mee more wofully to my selfe with these words. And yet am I brought to a greater mischiefe; with that fixing her weeping eyes vpon mine, which affectionately answered hers with lookes and teares. I must my Lord (said she) intreate you to refraine this place, since none can tell what danger may proceed from mad, and vnbridled iea|lousie; Refraine your sight? Commaund me then to die (said I). Haue I deseru'd to be thus punish'd? Shall his brutishnes vndoe my blessings? yet this place I will, since you will haue it so, hoping you will find some meanes to let me know Philargus house is not in all places. That I will doe, or die (said she). Miserable wretch (cry'd I), art thou borne to such fortune, as to 9 haue this Lady loue thee, and her vnmatched goodnes to suffer for one so worthlesse as thy selfe? No, no, my Lord (said she) in this you wrong me, and that iudgement which heretofore you said was in me, since if you were vn|worthy then, my choice was vnperfect: but you are worthie, and I worthily chose you; I lou'd you, and constantly lou'd you, and in this doe[...] I best allow of my owne iudgement. I hope that loue is not cleane gone (cri'd I), (my speech by loue directed to say thus), nor will you forget me, though from our most desired meetings, we must be barred. My loue, my Lord (said she) had, and hath too sure a ground to know remoue, I too truly lou'd, and doe loue you, euer to forget it, or to let it haue least shadow of lessening, though vai|led in absence, but rather (if increase can be where all is already possest) it shall increase; Loue liuing best where desert, and sufferance ioyne together; and for witnes of it, take this (said she, bestowing her picture vpon me, which is all the Limenas I shall now enioy, or euer did, more then her lou'd, and best b[...]loued sight. The case was blew, commanding me withall to loue that co|lor, both because it was hers, and because it self betokened truth. By this time her husband was come, who told vs, 'twas time to goe rest. We obay'd: and this was the last time that euer I saw my deere, and most worthily accounted deere Limena: for the next morning I was by day to be at the Citie, and so from thence to returne to the Campe. Thus tooke I my leaue, and my last leaue of vertuous Limena, whose sad face, but sadder soule foretold our fol|lowing harme, and succeeding ruine. For within few dayes after my returne to the Camp, there came a Messenger early in the morning, and (O too early for my fortune) whom I strait knew to be Limenas faithfull Seruant. At first, it brought ioy to me, seeing a letter in his hand; but soone was that turn'd to as much mourning, cursing my hands that tooke it, and eyes that read so lamentable a letter; the contents (nay that it selfe) being this, and the verie same my Mistris sent, and wo is me, the last she ere can send. Vrania read it, while he with teares and groanes gaue the true period to it. The Letter said thus.

MY onely Lord, thinke not this, or the manner strange I now send, knowing al|ready some part of the vndeserued course taken with me; only pitie her, who for your sake suffers patiently; accept these my last lines, and with them the sin|cerest loue that euer woman gaue to man. I haue not time to speake what I would, therefore let this satisfie you, that the many threatnings I haue heard, are come in some kind to end[...] for I must presently die, and for you; which death is most wel|come, since for you I must haue it, and more pleasing then life without you. Grant me then these last requests, which euen by your loue I coniure you not to denie me, that you loue my poore memory; and as you will loue that, or euer loued me, reuenge not my death on my murtherer, who, how vnworthy soeuer hee was, or is, yet hee is my Husband. This is all, and this grant, as I will faithfully die

Yours. 


Alas, faire Shepherdesse (said he), is this a letter without much sorrow to be read? and is not this a creature of all others to be belou'd? Neuer let him breath, that will not heartily, and most heartily lament such a misfortune. Tis 10 true, said Vrania, reason and worth being companions: but yet I heare not the certaintie or manner of her death, then will I not faile to lament with you. Alas, said hee, heare it of mee, onely fit to tell that storie. After my departure from his house to the Citie, and so to the Campe, the iealous wretch finding my Ladie retired into a Cabinet she had, where she vsed to passe away some part of her vnpleasant life: comming in, he shut the dore, drawing his sword, and looking with as much furie, as iealous spite could with rage demonstrate; his breath short, his sword he held in his hand, his eyes sparkling as thicke and fast, as an vnperfectly kindled fire with much blowing giues to the Blower, his tongue stammeringly with rage bringing foorth these words; thou hast wrong'd mee, vild creature; I say thou hast wronged mee: shee who was compounded of vertue, and her spirit, seeing his wild and distracted countenance guest the worst, wher|fore mildely shee gaue this answere. Philargus, saide shee, I knowe in mine owne heart I haue not wrong'd you, and God knowes I haue not wrong'd my selfe: these speeches, said he, are but the followers of your continued ill, and false liuing; but thinke no longer to deceiue me, nor cousen your selfe with the hope of being able, for in both you shall finde as much want, as I doe of your faith to me; but if you will speake confesse the truth: O me, the truth, that you haue shamed your selfe in my dishonour, say you haue wrong'd me, giuing your honour, and mine to the loose, and wanton plea|sure ofPerissus; was I not great enough, amiable, delicate enough, but for lasciuiousnesse you must seeke, and woo him? Yet Limena I did thus deserue you, that once better then my selfe I lou'd you, which affection liues in the extremitie [...]till, but hath chang'd the nature, being now as full of hate, as then abounding in loue, which shall instantly be manifested, if you consent not to my will, which is, that without dissembling speeches, or flattring fine|nes you confesse your shamefull loue to the robber of my blisse: you may denie it, for how easie is it to be faultie in words, when in the truth of truth you are so faultie? but take heede, vnfainedly answere, or here I vow to sa|crifice your blood to your wanton loue; My Lord, said she, threatnings are but meanes to strengthen free and pure hearts against the threatners, and this hath your words wrought in me, in whom it were a foolish basenesse for feare of your sword, or breath to confesse what you demaund, if it were true[...] farre more did I deserue eternall punishment, if I would belye him, and my selfe for dread of a bare threatning; since sure, that sword, were it not for danger to it selfe, would, if any noblenesse were in it, or his master, choose rather to dye it selfe in the blood of a man, then be seene in the wranglings betweene vs: yet doe I not denie my loue to Perissus in all noble, and worthy affection, being I thinke nurst with me, for so long haue I borne this respectiue loue to him, as I knowe no part of my memory can tell me the beginning. Thus partly you haue your will in assurance, that that vn|seperable loue I beare him, was before I knewe you, or perfectly my selfe, and shall be while I am, yet alwayes thus in a vertuous, and re|ligious fashion. O God, cry'd out Philargus what doe I heare? or what can you stile vertuous and religious, since it is to one besides your husband? hath shame possest you? and excellent modesty abandoned you? you haue in part satisfied me indeed, but thus to see, that I haue 11 iust occasion to seeke satisfaction for this iniury: wherefore, resolue instant|ly to die, or obey me, write a letter straight before mine eyes vnto him, coniure him with those sweete charmes which haue vndone mine honour, and content to come vnto you: Let me truely knowe his answere, and be se|cret, or I vow thou shalt not many minutes outliue the refusall. Shee, swee|test soule, brought into this danger, (like one being betweene a flaming fire, and a swallowing gulfe, must venture into one, or standing still, perish by one) stood a while not amazed, for her spirit scorned so low a passion; but iudicially considering with her selfe what might be good in so much ill; she with modest constancy, and constant determination, made this answer. This wretched, and vnfortunate body, is I confesse in your hands, to dispose of to death if you will; but yet it is not vnblest with such a mind as will suffer it to end with any such staine, as so wicked a plott, and miserable consent might purchase: nor will I blott my fathers house with Treason, Treason? Nay, the worst of Treasons, to be a Traytor to my friend. Wherefore my Lord pardon me, for I will with more willingnesse die, then execute your minde; and more happily shall I end, sauing him innocent from ill, deliue|ring my soule pure, and I vnspotted of the crime you tax me of, or a thought of such dishonour to my selfe; I might haue saide to you, but that this cruell course makes me thus part my honour from you; yet can you not part infa|my, and reproach from you, nor me, said he: Prepare then quickly, this shall be your last; My Lord said shee, behold before your eyes the most di|stress'd of women, who if you will thus murder, is here ready: then vnty|ing a daintie embrodered wast coate; see here, said she, the breast, (and a most heauenly breast it was) which you so dearely loued, or made me thinke so, calling it purest warme snow; yet neuer was the colour purer then my loue to you, but now 'tis ready to receiue that stroake, shall bring my heart blood, cherish'd by you once, to dye it, in reuenge of this my wrong reuenge; nay, such reuenge will my death haue, as though by you I die, I pittie your ensu|ing ouerthrow.
Whether these words, or that sight (which not to be seene without ado|ring) wrought most I knowe not, but both together so well preuaile as hee stood in a strange kind of fashion, which she (who now was to act her part for life, or death) tooke aduantage of, and this your cruelty will more ap|peare whe~ it is known you gaue no time for consideration, or repentance, said she; you deserue no such fauor from me, said he, but rather that I should with out giuing care to that bewitching tongue haue reueng'd my harme, but since I haue committed this first, like faultie men, I must fall into another: Charity, but in no desert of yours, procures this fauour for you; two dayes I giue you, at the end of which be sure to content me with your answere, or content your selfe with present death. The ioy she at this conceiued, was as if assured life had beene giuen her, wherefore humbly thanking him, she pro|mised to satisfie him so fully at that time, as he should (she hop'd) be pleased with it. Away [...]hee went leauing her to her busie thoughts, yet somewhat comforted, since so shee might acquaint mee with her afflictions, for which cause grieuing that I should be ignorant of the true meanes to her end, she so prettily gain'd that little time for the rarest lampe of excellent life to endure. Then called she a faithfull seruant of hers, and the same who brought me 12 the dolefull letter: First, she coniured him by the faith hee bare her, to obey what shee commaunded, and to bee secret; then related shee this soule rendring storie to him, which shee inioyn'd him truly to discouer to mee, by his helpe getting pen and paper, and hauing written that do|lorous, yet sweete, because louing letter, sent him to mee that day shee was to giue her answere, which shee assured him should bee a direct re|fusall, esteeming death more pleasing and noble, then to betray me, who (for my now griefe mixt with that blessing) shee inricht with her incom|parable affection, giuing him charge to deliuer it to mine owne hands, and besides, to stay with mee, assuring him I would most kindly intreat him for her sake, which shee might truly warrant him, being Commandresse of my soule. Hee found mee in my Tent, ready to goe forth; with a wan and sad countenance hee gaue that and my death together; then tel|ling the lamentable storie I now deliuered you. With flouds of teares, and stormes of sighes hee concluded: And by this, is the rarest peece of woman-kinde destroyed. Had I growne into an ordinary passion like his of weeping, sobbing, or crying, it had not been fit for the excessiue losse I was falne into; wherefore like a true Cast-away of fortune, I was at that instant metamorphosed into miserie it selfe, no other thing being able to equall mee, no more then any, except the owne fellow to a cockle shell, can fit the other. This change yet in mee, which to my selfe was so sudden as I felt it not, was so marked by my friends, and by all admired, as those who feared the least, doubted my end; which would it then had happened, since, if so the earth no longer had borne such a wretch,, this sad place been molested with a guest perpetually filling it; and these places neere, with my vnceasing complaints. Despaire hauing left mee no more ground for hope but this, that ere long I shall ease them all, death prouing mercifull vnto mee, in deliuering this griefe-full body to the rest of a desired graue. My Lord Perissus (said Vrania), how idle, and vnprofitable indeed are these courses, since if shee bee dead, what good can they bring to her? and not being certaine of her death, how vnfit are they for so braue a Prince, who will as it were, by will without reason wilfully lose himselfe? will not any till the contrarie bee knowne, as properly hope as vainely de|spaire? and can it bee imagined her husband (who, passion of loue did in his furie so much temper) should haue so cruell a hand, guided by so sauage a heart, or seene by so pitilesse eyes, as to be able to murder so sweet a beauty? No my Lord, I cannot beleeue but she is liuing, and that you shal find it so, if vnreasonable stubborne resolution bar you not, and so hinder you from the eternall happinesse you might enioy. Only rare Shepherdesse (said the loue-kill'd Perissus), how comfortable might these speeches bee to one, who were able to receiue them, or had a heart could let in one signe of ioy? but to me they are rather bitter, since they but cherish mee the longer to liue in despairefull miserie. No, shee is dead, and with her is all vertue, and beauteous constancy gone. She is dead: for how can goodnesse or pitie bee expected from him, who knew nothing more, then desire of ill and crueltie? Thou art dead, and with thee all my ioyes departed, all faith, loue and worth are dead: to enioy some part of which, in short time I will bee with thee, that though in life wee were kept asunder, in death 13 we may bee ioyn'd together, till which happie hower I will thus still lament thy losse. If you bee resolu'd (said the daintie Vrania), folly it were to offer to perswade you from so resolute a determination; yet being so braue a Prince, stored with all vertuous parts, discretion and iudgement, mee thinks, should not suffer you to burie them in the poore graue of Loues passion, the poorest of all other: these inuite mee, as from your selfe, to speake to your selfe; Leaue these teares, and woman-like complaints, no way befitting the valiant Perissus, but like a braue Prince, if you know shee bee dead, reuenge her death on her murderers; and after, if you will celebrate her funeralls with your owne life giuing, that will bee a famous act: so may you gaine perpetuall glorie, and repay the honor to her dead, which could not bee but touched by her vntimely end. Her honour toucht, and toucht for mee? O immortall God (cride he), thou wilt not (I hope) let a slaue liue should touch on such a thought, nor me to liue after it were borne, if not to sacrifice my bloud to wash away the staine. But I pray you since you vndertake thus to aduise mee, how can I doe this, and yet obey myLimena's commaund, in not reuenging her death? Why that (replide the discreet Vrania) proceeded whollie from the loue shee bare you, which rather is another motiue to stirre you, if you consider it, since the danger shee apprehended you would runne into, to right so delicate, yet vnhappilie, iniured a Ladie, and for you iniured, forced her to vse her authoritie for your safetie. But let not that preuail[...], nor hinder a deadlie reuenge for so detestable a fact. Thus shall you approoue your selfe, a braue and worthie Louer, deseruing her, who best deseru'd: but let it neuer be said, Perissus en|ded vnreuenged of Philargus, and concluded his dayes like a Fly in a corner. These wordes wrought so farre in the noble heart of Perissus, as rising from his leauie Cabine, then thus said hee: Is Perissus the se|cond time conquerd? I must obey that reason which abounds in you; and to you, shall the glory of this attempt belong: now will I againe put on those habites which of late I abandoned, you hauing gaind the victorie ouer my vowe. But I beseech you, tell mee who my Counsel|lor is, for too much iudgement I finde in you, to be directly, as you seeme, a meere Shepherdesse, nor is that beauty sutable to that apparell. My name, said shee, is Vrania, my bringing vp hath been vnder an old Man, and his wife, who, till lately, I tooke for my Father and Mother but they telling me the contrary, and the manner of their finding me, makes mee find I am lost, and so in truth, is much of my content, not being able to know any more of my selfe: I delighted before to tend a little Flocke, the old paire put into my handes, now am I troubled how to rule mine owne thoughts. This doe I well credit, said Perissus, for more like a Prin|cesse, then a Shepherdesse doe you appeare, and so much doe I re|uerence your wisedome, as next vnto Limena, I will still most honor you: and therefore, faire Vrania, (for so I hope you will giue mee leaue to call you), I vow before heauen and you, that I will neuer leaue off my Armes, vntill I haue found Philargus, and on him reueng'd my Ladies death, and then to her loue and memory, offer vp my af|flicted life: but first shall you haue notice of the successe, which if 14 good, shall bee attributed to you; if ill, but to the continuance of my ill destinie. But if your fortune call you hence before you shall be found by them, I will imploy (since the world hath not a place can keepe the beautie of Vrania hidden, if seene, then will it not bee adored), they shall not leaue, till they haue found you; nor will you scorne that name from mee, who shall now leaue you the incomparable Vrania. With these words they went out of the Caue, hee straight going to a large Holly tree (the place rich with trees of that kind), on which at his comming to that melancholy abiding, hee had hung his Armor, meaning that should there remaine in memorie of him, and as a monument after his death, to the end, that whosoeuer did finde his bodie, might by that see, hee was no meane man, though subiect to fortune. Them hee tooke downe and arm'd himselfe, but while hee was arming, Vrania entreated him to doe one thing more for her, which was to tell her how he came to that place. And that was ill forgot most faire Vrania (said hee): then know that as soone as I had receiued that letter so full of sorrow, and heard all that miserable relation, I was forced, notwithstanding the vow I had to my selfe made (of this solitary course you haue reli[...]ued mee from) to goe against the Enemie, who with new forces, and vnder a new Lea|der, were come within sight of our Army: I thinking all mischiefes did then conspire together against mee, with an inraged furie went towards them, hoping (and that onely hope was left mee) in that encounter to ende my life, and care together in the battaile, yet not slightly to part with it, in my soule wishing euerie one I had to deale withall had been Philargus. This wish after made mee doe things beyond my selfe, for|cing not only our company and party to admire me, but also the contrary to bee discouraged, so as wee got the day, and not onely that, but an end of the warres: for the chiefe Traytors being either kild or taken, the rest that outliu'd the bloudy slaughter, yeelded themselues to mer|cie, whom in my Vncles name I pardoned, on condition that instant|ly they disbanded, and euerie one retire to his owne home. This done, and my Vncle quietly setled in his seate, in the midst of those triumphs which were for this happy Victorie, I stole away, leauing a letter with my new Seruant, directed to the King, wherein I humbly asked pardon for my priuate departure, and with all the intreates that I could frame, perswaded him to entertaine that seruant of mine, and to accept of him as recommended by mee, and accordingly to esteeme of him. Then tooke I my way first to her Fathers, to know the manner and certain|tie, where I found vnspeakable mourning and sadnesse, her Mother rea|die to die with her, as if shee had brought her forth to bee still as her life, that though two, yet like those eyes, that one being struck in a certaine part of it, the other vnhurt doth lose likewise the sight: so she hauing lost her, lost likewise all comfort with her; the seruants mourn'd, and made pitifull lamentations: I was sorry for them, yet gratefully tooke their mourning: for mee thought it was for mee, none being a|ble to grieue sufficiently, but my selfe for her losse. When her Mother saw me, who euer she well lou'd, she cry'd out these words: O my Lord, see here the miserable Woman depriu'd of all ioy, hauing lost my Limena, 15 your respected friend. Full well do I now remember your words, when with gentle and mild perswasions, you would haue had vs stay her going from this place vnto his house. Would we had then fear'd, or beleeu'd: then had she bin safe, whereas now she is murdred. Murdred (cri[...]d I), O speak againe, but withall how? Her husband, said she, led her forth, where in a Wood, thicke enough to shade all light of pitie from him, hee killed her, and then burnt her, her clothes found in the Wood besmeard with blood, and hard by them the remnant of a great fire; they with such store of teares, as had been able to wash them cleane, and quench the fier, were brought to the house by those, who went to seeke her, seeing her long stay; not mistrusting harme, but that they had forgotten themselues. The rest seeing this dolefull spectacle, rent their haire, and gaue all testimony of true sorrow: then came these newes to vs; how welcom, iudge you, who I see feele sorrow with vs: her father & bro|thers arm'd themselues, and are gone in search of him, who was seene with all speed [...]o passe towards the Sea. Thus heare you the Daughters misfor|tune, which must be followed by the mothers death: and God send, that as soone as I wish, my Lord and Sonnes may meet with that vngrateful wretch to reuenge my miserable childs losse. This being done, she swounded in my armes, my selfe being still in my transformed estate, helpt her as much as I could, then deliuering her to her seruants, I tooke my leaue, buying this ar|mour to goe vnknowne, till I could find a place sad enough to passe away my mournefull howres in. Many countries I went thorow, and left (for all were too pleasant for my sorrow), till at last I lighted on this happie one, since in it I haue receiued as much comfort by your kind and wise counsell, as is possi|ble for my perplexed heart to entertaine. By this time hee was fully armed, which made the sweet Vrania admire him; and if more pitie had lodg'd in her then before, she had affoorded him; his goodly personage and dolefull lookes so ill agreeing, had purchased; for she did pitie him so much, as this had almost brought the end of some kind of pitie, or pitie in some kind loue: but she was ordain'd for another, so as this prou'd onely a fine beginning to make her heart tender against the others comming. Now was he ready to de|part, wherefore they came downe from the rock, when being at the bottome they met a young sh[...]pherd, whose heart Vrania had (although against her will) conquered. This Lad shee entreated to conduct Perissus to the next town, which he most willingly consented to, thinking himselfe that day most happy when she vouchsafed to command him; withall she inioyned him, not to leaue him, till he saw him shipt, which hee perform'd, comming againe to her to receiue thanks more welcome to him, then if a fine new flock had bin bestowed on him. Perissusgone, Vrania for that night draue her flock home|ward, giuing a kind looke vnto the rocke as she return[...]d, promising often to visit it for braue Perissus sake, and to make it her retiring place, there to passe some of her melancholy howres in. The next morning as soone as light did appeare, or she could see light (which sooner she might doe then any, her eyes making day, before day else was seene) with her flocke she betooke her selfe to the meadow, where she thought to haue met some of her compani|ons, but being early, her thoughts hauing kept more carefull watch ouer her eies, thought it selfe growne peremptorie with such authority. She found none come, wherefore leauing the flocke to the charge of a young Lad of 16 hers, tooke her way towards the rocke, her mind faster going then her feete, busied still, like one holding the Compasse, when he makes a circle, turnes it round in his owne center: so did shee, her thoughts incircled in the igno|rance of her being. From this she was a little mou'd by the comming of a pretie Lambe towards her, who with pitifull cries, and bleatings, demanded her helpe, or she with tender gentlenes imagined so; wherefore she tooke it vp, and looking round about if she could see the dam, perceiuing none, wan|dred a little amongst bushes and rude places, till she grew something wearie, when sitting downe she thus began to speake: Poore Lambe, said she, what moane thou mak'st for losse of thy deare dam? what torments do I then suf|fer, which neuer knew my mother? thy misse is great, yet thou a beast may'st be brought vp, and soone contented hauing food; but what food can bee gi|uen me, who feede on nothing but Despaire, can that sustaine me? No, want of knowledge starues me, while other things are plentifull. Poore innocent thing; how doth thy wailing sute with mine? Alas, I pitie thee, my selfe in some kind wanting such a pitie. Then shee did heare a noise in the bushes, looking what it should be, she saw a fierce she-wolfe come furiously towards her: she, who (though a spirit matchlesse liued in her) perceiuing her, wish|ed the beast further, yet taking her wonted strength of heart, and vertuous thoughts together, she thus said; O heauen defend me miserable creature if thou please; if not, grant me this blessing, that as I shall here end, not know|ing any parents to sorrow for me, so those parents (if liuing) may neuer know my losse, lest they doe grieue for me. As shee thus religiously gaue her thoughts, and her last, as shee thought to the highest, the beast running to|wards her of the sudden stood still; one might imagine, seeing such a heauenly creature, did amase her, and threaten for medling with her: but such conceits were vaine, since beasts will keepe their owne natures, the true reason being, as soone appear'd, the hasty running of two youths, who with sharpe speares, soone gaue conclusion to the supposed danger, killing the wolfe as shee stood hearkning to the noise they made. But they not seeing Vrania, who on her knees was praising God, said one to another, Alas, haue we hasted to kill this beast, which now is not for our turne, little helpe can this giue to our sicke father. Vrania then looked vp, hearing humane voices, which she so little expected, as onely death was that she looked for: but then per|ceiued she two young men, whose age might bee iudged to bee some seuen|teene yeares; faces of that sweetnesse, as Venus loue could but compare with them, their haire which neuer had been cut, hung long, yet longer much it must haue been, had not the daintie naturall curling somewhat shortned it, which as the wind mou'd, the curles so pretily plaid, as the Sunne-beames in the water; their apparrell Goates skinnes cut into no fashion, but made fast about them in that sort, as one might see by their sight they were wild; yet that wildnesse was gouern'd by modesty, their skinne most bare, as armes and leggs, and one shoulder, with part of their thighes; but so white was their skinne, as seem'd the Sunne in loue with it, would not hurt, nor the bushes so much as scratch; on their feete they had a kind of shooes, which came vp to the anckle. Thus they were before the Prime of Shepherdesses, who com|ming to them, and saluting them, they stept back in wonder to see that beau|tie, which yet in the masculine they came neere to, then laying admiration so 17 farre a part, as to keepe themselues safe from rudenesse in some kind, one of them began: Diuine creature, pardon this our boldnesse, which hath brought vs thus rudely to your presence, if we haue offended, let our humilitie in sor|row excuse vs; or if this beast we haue kild was fauour'd by you, take vs who are rude men, to serue you in that stead: in the meane time accept our peti|tion to bee forgiuen our fault. Vrania, who had before in their out-sides seene enough to be wondred at, hearing their speech, bred more admiration, she answered them; Your beauties mixt with so much mildnesse and sweet|nesse, might pleade for you, if you had offended, which I saw not: but in ha|uing giuen too much respect to me, the most miserable of women; nor any rudenes see I, but in that beast which you haue so manfully destroy'd: if your habits shew wildnesse, your speech takes away that error; nor haue you com|mitted any fault, if not in sauing mee to liue to greater miseries. The young men then blushing, humbly thanking her, were taking their leaues, when she curteously desired them, that since they had rescued her, she might know the men that saued her, and the aduenture brought them thither. They answe|red; Withall their hearts they would satisfie her demand, but for that time desired to be excused, since they were sent by their old weake father to get some food for him, which when they had done, they would returne to her. She hearing this; Alas (said she), shal you who haue kept me out of the throat of a rauening wolfe, want what I may helpe you to? Goe to your father, I will accompanie you; this Lambe shall feede him, at this time sent of pur|pose without doubt, to cherish so good and blest a man, as is father to two such sonnes: and then may I know your storie and his together. They happy to see so fit a dish for his age, on their knees would haue thanked her, but she hindred them; and so together they went towards the place where hee re|main'd, which was in a Caue vnder a great rock neere to the sea; when they a|riu'd at the place, the elder of the two went in, telling the old man of the faire shepherdesses co~ming, and her kindnes to him. Wherfore he sent out a yong maid, who was cloth'd in plaine (but neat) apparrell: of such beautie, as who had seene her alone, would haue thought her incomparable, but Vrania excel|led her; meeting of her, knowing by the youth she was his sister, most sweet|ly saluted her, taking her by the hand, went in, where they found the old man so feeble, as [...]e had but his tongue left to serue himselfe or them withall: and well did it then serue him for the good of the young men, thus beginning to Vrania: Admired Shepherdes, and most worthy to bee so; since the inward beauty of your mind so much excells the peereles excellency of your outward perfections, as vertue excels beauty, see here a poore signe of greatnes, ouer|whelm'd with misfortune, and be as you are, all excelling, a happy meanes to aidean els destroi'd hope of rising; sit down here, and grudge not me that ho|nor; for before the story be ended, you wil see more reason to pity the~ scorn, and you my sons & daughter come neere, for now shal you know that, which I haue til this present kept from you, for feare I shuld not els haue held you in this poore, but quiet liuing. They being ready to sit, & heare the story, a mans voice made the~ stay, & Vrania intreated (as in lesse danger if seene then the o|ther) to go forth, she perceiu'd a gentlema~ of that delicacy for a ma~, as she was struck with wo~der; his sweetnes & fairnes such, as the rarest painters must con|fes the~selues vnable to cou~terfeit such perfections, & so exquisit proportion. 18 He had a mantle richly embroidered with pearle and gold, the colour of that and his other apparrell being watchet suitably imbrodered, his haire faire and shining, so young he was, as hee had but the signe of a beard; Armes he had none, saue a sword to defend himselfe, or offend his enemies, hee came softly and sadly on towards the rocke, but his eyes to the seaward: she beholding him, said; O sweet Iland, how mai'st thou indeed boast thy self for being the harbour of all excellent persons. He whose mind was distant from him, held his eyes and thoughts as at first fixt, beseeching the sea, if shee had Amphilanthus in her power, shee would be pitifull vnto him: after hee had concluded these words, he (whose soule was absent from him) lookt towards the Iland, when his eyes were soone called to admire, and admiringly behold the rare Shepherdesse, who in the same kind of wonder lookt on him. He ra|uished with the sight, scarce able to thinke her an earthly creature, stood ga|zing on her. She who poore soule had with the sight of Perissus, giuen leaue for loue to make a breach into her heart, the more easily after to come in and conquer, was in so great a passion, as they seem'd like two Master-pieces, fram'd to demonstrate the best, and choisest skill of art, at last (as men haue the stronger and bolder spirits) he went vnto her, not remouing his eyes in the least from hers, and with a braue, but ciuill manner thus spake vnto her. If you be, as you seeme an incomparable Shepherdesse, let me bee so much fa|uour'd of you, as to be permitted to aske some questions: but if you be a hea|uenly person as your rarenesse makes me imagine, let me know, that by the humble acknowledging my fault, I may gaine pardon. Alas Sir, said Vrania, so farre am I from a heauenly creature, as I esteeme my selfe the most misera|ble on earth; wherefore if any seruice I can doe may pleasure you, I beseech you command me, so may I receiue some happinesse, which I shall obtaine in obeying you. What I will demaund, said he, shall be such things as you may easily grant, and by that make me your seruant. I desire to know what this place is, but most what you are: for neuer can I beleeue you are as you seeme, vnlesse for the greater wonder all excellencie, should be masked vnder this Shepherdesse attire. For the perfections in me, as you call them, said Vrania, were they not made perfect by so excellent a Speaker, would be of no more value, then the estimation I make of my poore beautie; touching your de|maunds, I will as well as I can satisfie you in them. This Iland is called Pan|talaria, gouern'd by an ancient worthie Lord called Pantalerius, who hauing receiu'd some discontent in his owne Countrie, with his family, and some o|thers that lou'd and seru'd him, came hither, finding this place vnpossest, and so nam'd it after his owne name, hauing euer since in great quiet and pleasure remained here; himselfe and all the rest taking the manner and life of shep|heards vpon them, so as now this place is of all these parts most famous for those kind of people. For my selfe I can say nothing, but that my name is Vrania, an old man and his wife hauing bred me vp as their owne, till within these few daies they told me that, which now more afflicts me, then the po|uertie of my estate did before trouble me, making me so ignorant of my selfe as I know no parents. For they told me, that I was by them found hard by the sea-side, not farre from these rocks, laid in a cradle with very rich clothes about me, a purse of gold in the cradle, and a little writing in it, which warn'd them that should take me vp to looke carefully to me, to call me Vrania, and 19 when I came to sixeteene yeeres of age to tell this to me, but by no meanes before, this they haue truely performed, and haue deliuered me the mantle and purse, that by them, if good fortune serue, I may come to knowledge; inioyning me besides, not to keepe this my story secret from any, since this sweet place intising many into it, may chance to bring some one to re[...]ease me from this torment of Ignorance. It could not be otherwise, said he, since such sweetnes, and peerelesse louelynesse are match'd together. But now, said Vrania, let me know I beseech you, who I haue discouer'd my selfe vnto; Let vs sit downe, said he, vnder these Rockes, and you shall know both who I am, and the cause of my comming hither: Nay, answered Vrania, if it please you, let vs rather goe into a Caue hard by, where I haue left an olde weake man, ready to tell me his Story, hauing with him two of the finest youths, and a Maide of the rarest beauty that eye can behold, and desirous he is to speake, for long he cannot endure. So together they came into the Caue, the graue man reuerently with bowing downe his head, saluting him thus; Braue Sir, for Maiestie doe I perceiue in your countenance, which makes me giue you this title, Welcome to my poore abiding, and most wel|come, since now I trust, I shall dispose of my Sonnes, according to my long wish and desire: sit I beseech you downe, and tell me who you are, that then I may discourse to you the lamentable fortune I and these my children are fallen into. The stranger sate downe betweene the old man and the ex|cellent Shepherdesse, beginning his Tale thus. My name sa[...]d he, is Parse|lius, Prince of Morea, being eldest Sonne vnto the King thereof, which Countrie I left with a deare friend of mine, who besides the vntying band of friendship we liue linked in, is my kinsman, and heire to the Kingdome of Naples, called Amphilanthus, resoluing not to returne, till wee had heard newes of a lost Sister of his, who in the first weeke after her birth was sto[...]ne away, since which time an old man, whether by diuination or knowledge, assured the King her Father, shee is liuing. Wherefore the most braue of Princes, Amphilanthus, resolu'd to seeke her, my selfe louing him as well, or better then my selfe, would not be denied to accompany him: for ha|uing bene euer bred in neerenesse of affections, as well as in conuersation to|gether, it could not be, but we must like the soule and body liue, and moue: so we betooke our selues to the Sea, leauing Morea, passing many aduen|tures in diuers Countries, still seeking the least freq[...]ented, and priuatest pla|ces keeping to the West, for that way wee were directed by the wise man. At last we arriu[...]d in Sicilie, which Country we found in great trouble, warres being broke out againe after the departure of Perissus, Nephew to the King, who had setled the State in good peace and quiet. But their hearts either not fully reconcil'd, or only reconciled to him, after his departure, which as we heard was strange and sudden, being neuer since heard of, they rebelled a|gaine; but we soone appeas'd the busines, setling the King in his seat with all quiet and safety. Then did Amphilanthus and I, though against my heart, part our bodies, but neuer shall our minds be parted, he in one ship, taking I know not iustly what course, but I trust the happiest: my selfe guided by for|tune, not appointing any one place to bend to, was brought hither, promi|sing at our parting to meete at his Fathers Court in Italie within twelue moneths after. But shorter I hope now my iourney will bee, since I 20 verily beleeue, you most faire Shepherdesse are the lost Princesse, and rather doe I thinke so, because you much resemble Leonius, the younger brother to Amphilanthus, whose beautie in man cannot be equall'd, though surpassed by you. When he had concluded, the old man with teares thus said: O Almigh|tie God, how great are thy blessings to me, that before I die, thou doft thus bring the most desired happinesse I could wish for, in sending hither that Prince, who onely can restore our good vnto vs. Most mighty and worthilie honourd Prince; see here before your royall presence, the vnfortunate king of Albania, who in the warres betweene Achaya and Macedon, taking part with Achaya, was beaten out of my country, and forced to wander, seeking safetie far from the place, where my safety ought most to haue been. I came to your fathers Court, it is true, poore, and vnlike a Prince, which sight tooke away so much as pitie; Courtiers, rather out of their brauery, contemning, then compassionating extremitie: besides, your Mother, being Sister to the Macedonian king then liuing, would not permit me any fauour, my king|dome in the meane while spoild, and parted among such, as could preuaile by strength and policy to get shares. When I found my selfe in this misery, with my wife and some few friends we went away, leauingMorea, and al hope of gaining any good in Greece, following what course our stars would guide vs to, we came hither, where it pleased God to blesse vs with these two boies, and this daughter, after whose being seauen yeares old, she died. Yet for all it is, and was a ioy to me, to see of my owne for my posterity, finding that like|lihood of princely vertues (as I hope) shalbe one day manifested, it hath grie|ued mee to thinke how I should leaue them; but now my hopes are reuiued, since I trust that danger is past; your noble, and magnanimous vertues being such, as to take pitie of any, how much more then wil your honor be, to assist distressed Princes? And now may you well do it, since a seruant of mine, who I haue oft[...]n sent thither, to see how things passe, doth assure me, your Vncle is dead, and a mighty Lord being next heire-male, which by the lawes of the country was otherwise, hath got the Crowne, hauing inclosed your faire young cosin, right heire to the kingdom of Macedon, being only daughter to the late king, in a strong tower til she be of age, & then to marry her; or if shee refuse, to keep her there stil, and this is the best she can expect. Wherefore sir, thus you are bound to rescue her: then I beseech you take these two young men into your protection, who till now, knew no other, then that they were meane boies, I not daring to let them know their birth, lest those great spirits which liue in them, should haue led the~ into some dangerous course: but still I haue kept them vnder, making them know hardnes and misery, the better still to endure it, if so crosse their fortunes be; or if they come to enioy their right, they may know the better to command, hauing so well learn'd to obey and serue. And most delicate Shepherdes, do you I pray accept of this young maid for your friend and companion, since if you bee the King of Naples daughter, or any other Princes, you need not scorne the companie of the Albanian Kings daughter. Parselius taking the old King in his arm[...]s; And is it my good fortune most famous King of Albania (said hee) to haue it in my power to serue so excellent a Prince? Doubt not then but I will with all faithfull loue and diligence (as soone as I haue concluded this [...]earch, with meeting my dearest friend in Italie) goe into Morea, and 21 from thence carry such forces as shall (with my other friends I will ioyne with me) restore you to your right, and pull downe that Macedonian Vsur|per, were it but for wronging you. But since I haue so faire an occasion to reuenge such iniuries offered so vertuous a Prince as your selfe, in keeping a kingdome, and vsurping another from his rightfull Queene, I am doubly bound: your sonnes I accept to bee my companions, and as brothers to me will I be carefull of them; the like did Vrania promise for the young Lady. Then the old king before ouer-charged with sorrow, was now so rauish|ed with ioy, as not being able to sustaine, bursting into flouds of kind teares, and his soule turn'd into a passion of ioy vnsupportable, being onely able to kisse the Prince Parselius and Vrania, imbracing, blessing, and kissing his children, giuing them charge faithfully and louingly to obserue[...] and loue that braue Prince, and sweet Shepherdes, like a child for quiet ending, gaue vp the ghost in their armes he best did loue. Great sorrow was made among them for his death; but then growing almost night, Vrania for that time went home, leauing the three to attend the Kings body till the next mor|ning, directing Parselius to the sad abiding of the perplexed Perissus, pro|mising to come to the Caue by Sunne rising to dispose of all things.
Vrania being come home, little meate contented her, making haste to her lodging, that there shee might discourse with her selfe of all her afflictions priuately, and freely, throwing her selfe on her bed, she thus beganne: Alas,Vrania, how doth miserie loue thee, that thus makes thee continuallie her companion? What is this new paine thou feel'st? What passion is this thy heart doth entertaine? I haue heard my ima|gined Father, and many more, talke of a thing called Loue, and de|scribe it to be a delightfull paine, a sought, and cherish'd torment, yet I hope this is not that: for [...]laue am I enough already to sorrow, no neede haue I then to be oppressed with passion: Passion, O passion! yet thou rulest Me. Ignorant creature to loue a stranger, and a Prince, what hope hast thou, that because thou art not knowne, thou shouldst be knowne to loue in the best place? I had rather yet offend so then in a meane choice, since if I be daughter of Italy, I chose but in mine owne ranke, if meaner, ambition is more noble then basenesse. Well then, if I doe loue, my onely fault is in too soone louing; but neither in loue, nor choice: Loue pleade for me, since if I offend, It is by thy power, and my faults must, as made, be salu'd by thee. I confesse, I am wonne, and lost, if thou, braue Prince, pittie not, and saue me. Sweet Chastity, how did I loue, and honor thee? Nay, almost vowe my selfe vnto thee, but I haue fail'd, Loue is the more powerfull God, and I was borne his subiect: with that she rose vp and went to the window to see if it were day, neuer know|ing before, what it was to wish for any thing (except the knowledge of her selfe) now longs for day, watches the houres, deemes euery minute a yeare, and euery houre an Age, till she againe inioy'd Parselius sight, who all that night tooke as little rest; hope, loue, and feare so vexing him, and tyrannizing ouer him, as sleepe durst not close, nor seaze his eyes to any the least slumber, all his content being in thinking on Vrania; wishing from his soule shee were the lost Princesse, that then they might happily inioy; which wish by loue was chid, since loue was able in him to make 22 her great enough, and those wishes were but to adde to that which ought to be so perfect, as it selfe should of it selfe be sufficient to make happines, which is the greatest greatnes. Then did he resolue, whatsoeuer she was, to make her his Wife; his Father, Country, Friend, and all must loue Vrania. Thus all must yeeld to her, or lose him already yeelded. Hee whose youth and man|like conuersation scorn'd the poore name and power of loue is now become his Bondman, cries out on nothing but Vrania; thinks of nothing, hopes for nothing, but the gaine of her perfections to his loue: accusing this night for spitefully being longer then any other that euer he knew, affection and desire making it appeare tedious vnto him, and why? because it kept Vrania from him. O (would he say) how happy wert thou Parselius to land on this shore, where thou hast gaind the Goddesse of the earth to bee thy Mistris, Vrania to be thy loue? But then would a louers feare take him, making him trem|blingly sigh and say; But if she should not loue again, wretch of all men, what would become of thee? Courage then ioyning with hope, would bring him from that sad despaire, giuing him this comfort; Yet sure (said he) her heart was not fram'd of so excellent temper, her face of such beauty, and her selfe wholly made in perfectnesse, to haue cruelty lodged in her: No, shee was made for loue, then she must loue; and if so, pity will claime some part; and if any, or to any, who more deserues it then my selfe, who most affecteth her[...] With that he went to the mouth of the rocke, from whence he might disco|uerall the plaines, carefully and louingly beholding them: You blessed Plaines (said he) which daily haue that treasure, which the rest of the world wanting, confesseth sence of pouerty; dull earth, ignorant of your riches, nei|ther knowing, nor caring how to glory sufficiently for bearing, and continu|ally touching such perfections, why dost not thou with all excellencies striue to delight her? sending forth soft and tender grasse, mixt with sweetest flowers when she will grace thee, suffering thee to kisse her feete as shee doth tread on thee? but when she lies on thee, dost thou not then make thy selfe delicate, and change thy hardnes to daintines and softnes? Happy, most hap|py in her sweet weight; and yet when she doth leaue thee do not the flowers vade, and grasse die for her departure? Then hee perceiu'd her comming a farre off downe the plaines, her flocke some feeding but most leaping, and want only playing before her. And well may you doe this most lucky flocke (said hee) hauing such a Commandresse, and so faire a Guardian: well doth ioy become you, shewing you sensibly doe know the blessing you in|ioy. But what will you doe when she shall leaue you? leaue this pleasure, pine, starue, and die with so great miserie. Alas I pity you, for such a change will bee. And what wilt thou, sweet Iland, doe? let in the sea, be drown'd, and lose thy pleasant solitarines. Hauing thus said, he left the desolate rock, and went to meete her, who with equall loue and kindnesse met him; such indeed was their affection, as can be expressed by nothing but it selfe, which was most excellent. When the first passion was past, which ioy gouern'd for sight, loue taking the place of speech: Ah Vrania (said he); how did the Sun show himselfe in his brig[...]te[...]t and most glorious habits to entertaine thee in these meades, coueting to win thy fauour by his richnesse triumphing in his hope of gaine? What mou'd thy sight then in my soule? Think you not it grew to rauishing of my sences? The Sunne (said she) shin'd (mee 23 thought, most on you, being as if so fond, as he did giue himselfe to be your seruant, circling you about, as if he meant, that you should be the body, and himselfe serue for your beames. With that he tooke her hand, and with an affectionate soule kissed it, then went they together to the Caue where the two yong sauage Princes, and their Sister attended them: then did they priuately bury the old King, promising (if businesses went well, that they by Parselius fauour might recouer their right) to fetch his worthy body, and lay it with the other famous Kings of Albania.
This being agreed vpon they went out of the Caue, Steriamus and Selarinu (for so the yong Princes were called) went first in their sauage habits, which they resolued to weare till they came where they might fit themselues with apparell, and Armes befitting their Estates: Parselius then promising to knight them: Next after them went theMorean Prince leading Vrania, and she holding Selarina by the hand. Being come into the Plaine, Parselius againe speaking to Vrania, vrged the likely-hood of her being the lost Princesse, be|sides, assuring her, howsoeuer, of no lower an Estate if she would goe with him. She made him this answer. A Prince, said she, can demand or pro|mise but Princely things; I beleeue you to be so, because you say so; and that face, me thinkes, should not dissemble, out of this I credit you, and so consent to goe with you; then nobly and vertuously, as I trust you, dispose of me. He casting vp his eyes to Heauen, Let me, nor my attempts pro|sper, said he, when I breake faith and vertuous respect to you; now let vs to the Ship. Nay, I beseech you first, said shee, permit me to take my leaue of my good friends, and formerly supposed Parents, lest my absence bring their death, if ignorant of my fortune: besides, wee will carry the mantle and purse with vs. He soone agreed vnto it, and so together they went to the house, the late abiding of the matchlesse Shepherdesse, where they found the good old folkes sitting together before the doore, expecting the returne of Vrania. But when they saw her come so accompanied, they wondred at it; and though poore, yet were they ciuill, wherefore they went towards them, and hearing by the faire Shepherdesse who the Princes were, kneeled downe, and would haue kissed the hand of Parselius: but he who respected them for their care of Vrania, would not permit them to doe so much reuerence, lif|ting them vp, and imbracing them, told them the same story of his trauell, and cause thereof, as he had done to Vrania, and then concluded, that the likeli|hood of her being that sought for Princesse, was the reason why they agreed to goe together, he promising to conduct her safely into Italy, and if she pro|ued the Princesse, to deliuer her to her father, which verily he beleeued he should doe; and seldome doe mens imaginations in that kind faile, especially hauing so good grounds to lay their hopes vpon. The old folkes sorry to part with Vrania, yet knowing she was not ordain'd to tarry with them, would not seeme to contradict their wills: wherefore fetching the mantle and purse with the little writing deliuered them to Vrania, whose good disposition was such, as she could not refraine from teares when shee parted with them, they wishing their age would haue permitted them to haue attended her, but being feeble it was not for them to trauell, especially to go so vncertaine a iourney, but in their place they desired their daughter might serue her; which she willingly consented to.
24 Thus euerything concluded, they tooke their leaues, and way to the Ship, which they found where Parselius had left her, but not as hee had parted from her; for much more company was in her, and a strange encounter, he found his Seruants Prisoners, his Armes possess'd, and all his goods in the hands of a Pirat: yet had he gouern'd it so, as this mis-aduenture was not dicouer'd till they were aboord. Parselius alone in regard of his com|pany and some women, would neuerthelesse, haue ventured his life to haue kept Vrania free, such was his loue, by none to be surpassed: his compassi|on likewise was great on the other Princesse; in himselfe, feeling the iust cause, as he thought, they had to mistrust him, and his promises to be value|lesse, this accident being the first of their hoped for ioyes.
But shee, whose truth in beliefe would not permit her to haue the least part of suspition to enter, much lesse, lodge in her breast against him, hin|dered that braue (but doubtfull) attempt, vsing these speeches to him.
Be satisfied, my dearest friend, said she, and hazard not your selfe in this kinde, seeking to alter what is ordain'd by Fate, and therefore not to be changed: but rather giue vs example, as confidently, and mildly to suffer this aduersity, as happily we might haue enioyed the other we expected. He onely with a languishing, but (to her) louing looke, answer'd her, when the Pirat, contrarie to their expectation, came, and kneeling downe beforeVrania, vsed these words.
Let not, fairest Princesse, this accident trouble you, since your imprison|ment shall bee no other then the command of mee, and mine: neither most noble Sir, be you, or these other offended[...] for sooner will I doe vio|lence on my selfe then any way wrong those that come with this Lady: Bee patient, and you shall soone see, the cause of my taking this no|ble prey; this said, he rose, and placing them all on fine seats in the Cabine, where lately the Prince had sate free from both the bands of loue, and im|prisonment, himselfe sitting before them began his discourse in this manner (while the ship vnder saile was guided the way which he directed the Pilar) My name (said he) is Sandringall, borne and bred in the land of Romania, be|ing seruant to the King thereof: this King liued long as one may say, the fa|uorite of fortune, being blest in his gouernment with peace, and loue of his people, but principally happy in two children, a son, and a daughter, yonger by some yeares then her brother, he being called Antisius, and she Antisia; promising in their youthes all comfort to succeed in their age: but destinie herein commanded, disposing quite other waies, and thus it was. The King my Master hauing in his youth been a braue and valiant Prince, giuing him|selfe vnto the seeking and finishing aduentures, a strict league of friendship grew betweene him, and the King of Achaia, for whose sake he left his coun|try, with a great army assisting him against his Macedonian [...]nemie: after re|turning with honor and content, the Achaian King gratefull for such a cur|tesie, being growne in yeares, sent Embassadours to demand his daughter in marriage for his sonne, and withall to haue the Princesse sent vnto him, to be brought vp together, to the end, that conuersation (a ready friend to loue) might nurse their affections so wel, as she might as contentedly be his daugh|ter, as it was affectionately desired of him. His sonne, as towardly a Prince as those parts had, called Leandrus, with whom few Christian Princes will 25 compare, except the two Cousens Parselius and Amphilanthus: but to my dis|course. My Master soone consented to the Achayan kings demand, which al|though for the farnesse of the country he might haue refused; yet the neere|nes of their loues was such, as he could not deny him, or his request, resoluing instantly to send the one halfe of his happinesse to his old friend; and for this end he sent for me, but herewithal begins my miserie, caused by my treache|rie, which heartily I repent, and am ashamed of. I being arriued at his Court, out of an ancient confidence which he had of my loialtie to him, committed this charge vnto me, to see his Antissia carefully conducted and deliuered to the king of Achaya: giuing me directions, and counsel how to carry my selfe; besides sole authority and power in this embassage. Thus we departed, my wife attending on her person; accompanied we were with most of the nobi|lity, their loues being such, as they parted not til they saw the yong Princesse shipp[...]d. Couetousnes (a dangerous sin in this time) bred in my wife (seeing the infinite riches the father had sent with his child); her perswasions besides (or rather ioyn'd to the diuelish sense of gaine) made me consent to detesta|ble wickednes. Led by this wicked subtilty, we resolu'd not to take our way to Achaya, but to put in to some Island, there to sell the Iewels, and leaue the Princesse in a religious house, not to bee knowne while her deare Parents should esteeme her lost, we vsing the gaine to our owne profits. More cun|ningly to carry this, we sent a seruant of ours before into the ship, with such prouision as our plot required, towards night, the sweete young Lady embarqued, with beliefe to go into Achaya; we purposing nothing lesse: for in the dead time of the night wee set the ship on fire, hauing before (when most slept) conuaide the treasure into the long boate: then with as much a|masement as any (nothing like the bellows of that fuell) I tooke the Princesse in mine armes leaping into the boate, calling to my wife to follow me, with|all cutting the cord, lest others should leape in: she leaped, but short, her fin so heauy drowning her, and my trusty seruant, with al the knights, in number twenty, and the Ladies sent to attend Antisia were drown'd, or burnd, or both. Then play'd I the waterman, making towards the next shore we could discouer; day breaking gaue vs sight of one, yet only for flattring hope to play withall, not to be enioy'd, for instantly were we set on by rouers, who kept about these coasts. The Princesse they tooke from me, and all the treasure, leauing me in the boate, and towing it by the ship in the midst of the sea, left mee with bread and water for two dayes, but without oare, sayle, or hope; yet such, and so fauourable was my destinie, as within that time a Pirat scou|ring the seas tooke mee vp, who not long after was set vpon by another. But then did the first arme me to serue him, which in gratitude I did, and so well defended him, as we had the victorie by the death of the other, slaine with my hand: for requitall hereof, he bestowed the new won Barke vpon mee, and men to serue me. Glad was I of this, hauing meanes to search for the Princesse, which I vowed with true and humble repentance to performe, ne|uer giuing ouer, till I had found the lost Antisia, or ended my life in the ser|uice. And this is the reason I took you, for hauing landed here, and by chance seene you, I straight remembred your face, wherefore I determin'd by some way or other to compasse the meanes to get you before my parting hence; and had not this happy occasion befalne mee, some other had not failed 26 to atchiue my purpose. Then tell me where haue you been these ten yeeres[...] for so long it is since you were lost: and with all I beseech you let my sub|mission and repentance gaine my pardon. Truly (said Vrania) you haue told so ill a tale, as if I were the lost Princesse, I should scarce forget so great an in|iury: but satisfie your selfe with this, and the hope of finding her, while you haue in your power one, who (alas) is lost too. The Pirat at this grew much troubled and perplext, for so vnaduisedly hauing discouered his former ill: thus they remaind, the Pirat vext, Vrania grieu'd,Parselius in soule tormen|ted, the others moued as much, as respect in them to the other two, could moue in noble minds, least, or not at all, thinking of themselues, in compari|son of them: all sitting with armes cross'd, and eyes cast downe vpon the earth, except the Pirat, whose mind was busied with higher thoughts, none knowing to what end they would haue ascended, had not a voice awaked them, which came from a Sayler, who bad them prepare. This called not the rest from their sorrow, nor moued Vrania so much as to heare it, who sate not tearelesse, though speechles, while her sighes accompanied the wind in loud blowing. Sandringal looking forth, saw the cause of the cry proceeded from the sight of the great Pirat of Syracusa, whose force was therabouts too well knowne: then did he take his armes, deliuering Parselius his own into his hands, intreating his aide. Parseliuslifted vp his eies, and as he raised them, he placed them on Vrania, as the sphere where they alone should moue, vsing these words: Now haue we some hope, since once more I possesse my armes: those (in shew) sauage youths helping him. By this time was the other ship come to them, when there began a cruell fight betweene them: being grap|led, Parselius encountred the chiefe Pirat, Sandringal a blacke Knight, who was so strong and valiant, as Sandringal gaind much honour so long to hold out with him. Parselius kild his enemy, when at that instant the black Knight strake the head of Sandringal from his shoulders; which Parselius seeing, FarewelSandringal (said he), now are Antissia and Leandrus well reueng'd for thy treason. With that the black Knight commanded his part to bee quiet, himselfe throwing downe his sword, and pulling of his helme, ran and imbra|cedParselius, who knowing him to be Leandrus, with as much affection held him in his armes: thus was the busines ended, all growing friends by their ex|ample. Then were al the prisoners brought forth of both the ships, amongst whom he knew one to be the Squire of his deare friend and Cousen, Amphi|lanthus, and two Gentlemen who had mortall hatred (as it did appeare) one vnto the other: for no sooner came they together, but they would haue buf|feted each other, wanting weapons to doe more; the one of them Leandrus tooke into his custody, while the other began his story thus. My Lords (said he) first let me beseech pardon for this rudenes; next, claime iustice on this villaine, who hath not only wrong'd me, but in his vnmannerly discourse in|iur'd the brauest Christian Princes; and that you may know the truth, giue me liberty to speake this to you. My name is Allimarlus, borne in Romania, and Page I was vnto the King thereof; but being come to mans estate, and so much knowledge, as to see and commiserate my Masters misery, which had the floud from two springs; the first was the losse of his daughterAntissia, be|ing sent vnder the conduct of his faithfull (as he esteemed) seruant Sandringal (who so well hee trusted, as hee would haue ventured his life in his hands; 27 which appeared in putting the faire Antissia in his power, who as himselfe he loued) to be deliuered to the King of Achaia, desiring a match betweene her and the kings sonne, called the hopefull Leandrus; but in the way the ship was spoild by an vnlucky fire, and she (as it was coniectured) lost, which since proued otherwise, not being swallowed by the vnmercifull sea, but betraide by her Guardian, and stolne againe from him by Rouers; since which time little newes hath been heard of her, sauing hope of her liuing. The other, and greater affliction was, and is, a wicked woman he hath made his wife, after the death of his vertuous Queene, who died as soone as shee had seene her wor|thily beloued Sonne Antissius blessed with a Sonne, whom they called after his owne name, who hauing indured a long and paineful search for his Sister, at his returne tooke a sweet and excellent Lady, called Lucenia to wife; who, though she were not the fairest, yet truly was she beautifull, and as faire as a|ny in goodnesse, which is the choisest beauty. But this second marriage made them first know miserie, the king old, and passionately doting on her: shee young, politique and wicked, being the widow of a Noble man in the Coun|trie, whose beastlines and crueltie cost the Prince his life, and bred the ruine of the State, as I haue since my departure from thence, vnderstood by a Knight of that Country. But to my discourse: The King one day after hee had banished his sonne Antissius the Court, and by her damnable counsell put such iealousie into his head, as hee now feared and hated him, that once was three parts of his ioy. This and the losse of his other comfort Antissia, did so perplexe him, as one day being at dinner, he began with teares to speake of Antissius, blaming his vnnaturalnesse to him in his age, who had so tenderly and louingly cherished his youth: but little of that she would suffer him to discourse of, lest his deserued pitie might haue hindred her ends, and so her plots haue faild, or been discouered. Then spake he of his young friend and once hoped for son Leandrus, who in search of Antissia, was said to be slaine, by reason that his Squire return'd to the Court (after long seeking his Lord, who by misaduenture hee had lost), bringing his armour shrewdly cut and battered, which he had found in a meadow, but no newes of his Master; only this probabilitie of his losse a country fellow gaue him, telling him, that gal|lant men in gay armours had not farre off performed a gallant fight, wherein some were killed, and one Knights body carried thence by a Lady, who fol|lowed the Knight, hauing but one more with her, whither they went, or more of the matter, he could not tell. With this and the armour he return'd to the old King, who the kindest of fathers, did accordingly suffer for this too likely disaster. From that he fell to the last and first of his misfortune, spea|king of Antissia, and bewailing her losse: concluding, How miserable am I of all men, that doe liue to lament for these many afflictions? one child dead by his liuing vndutifulnes, the other lost by treachery in a man I most trusted; and to be besides, the occasion to bereaue my dearest friend of his only com|fort, which as one of my equall sorrowes I esteeme. I seeing his vexati|on, and iust cause of mourning, offered my best seruice in seeking the Prin|cesse, who not being dead, I might hope to find, and bring some content vnto his age. Hee hearing mee say this, fell vpon my necke, kissing my forehead, and yet weeping so, as they resembled the watry and parting kisses the sweet Riuers giue the sweeter bankes, when with ebbing they must 28 leaue them: so did his teares, so did his kisses on my face, both meet and part; at last his ioy-mixt sorrow let him speake these words: And wilt thou O Al|limarlus doe this for me? shall I yet find so true a friend? a seruant, and a faithfull one (said I) who will not liue, if not to serue you, and so my faith to liue in me. Then he tooke me vp in his armes, and calling for a sword of his, which he had worne in most of his aduentures, gaue that with the honour of Knighthood to me; then kissing his hands and the Queenes, I took my leaue. He, though glad to find my loyaltie, and hoping to heare some newes of his daughter, yet was sorry to part with me: so few were left that he could trust, his kind wife hauing taken care that her Minions and fauorites should most attend his person.
Long time was I not landed in Greece, in that part called Morea, before I met an old man, who told me something of the Princesse, but nothing of her certaine aboad: yet I reioyced to heare of her, not doubting but to bring her to delight her grieued father, who neuer indeed tasted of true happinesse since her losse, that being the thread to his succeeding miseries. That old man likewise told me, I was in my way of finding her, if I held on to Laconia. I earnestly desired his company, which he affoorded me, and so we went to|gether, resoluing still to enquire, and to leaue no likely place vnsought in all Greece, till we had found her. A prettie space we thus continued, the old man passing away the time with good discourse, which made the way seeme shorter, telling me many aduentures which had befalne him in his youth, ha|uing led the life that most braue spirits vse; but one I best remember (being his owne story, the place wherein we then were producing it), it was this, and in truth worthy of note. Whatsoeuer I now, faire Knight, (said he) ap|peare to be, know I am in birth quite contrary: poore, and alone now, once a Duke, and one of the mightiest, richest, ancientest, and sometimes happiest of these parts; this countrie wherein you are, being mine, onely subiect in ho|mage to the famous King of Morea; my education had been most in the court; my time, some spent there, some time abroad: but weary at last of either, as a hound wil be, who neuer so wel louing hunting, wil at last take rest: so did I lie downe at mine owne home, determining to end my daies in quiet plente|ousnes, taking my own delight; to adde vnto which, I brought with me a ver|tuous Lady, and such a one, as might for goodnes equal any of her ranke, and truly not vnbeautifull: yet so much was I besotted on a young man, whom I had vnfortunatly chosen for my companion, as at last all delights & pastimes were to me tedious and lothsome, if not liking, or begun by him. Nay, my wiues company in respect of his, was vnpleasing to me. Long time this conti|nued, which continuance made me issue-les, wherfore I made him my heire, giuing him all the present honor I could in my own power, or by the fauor of the king (who euer grac'd me much) procure him. But he the son of wicked|nes, though adopted to me, esteeming possessio~ far better then reuersio~, gaue place so much to couetousnesse, as murder crept into credit to attaine the profit, wherefore he practised to make me away: my friends and kindred had before left me, expecting nothing but my ruine, seeing me so bewitch'd with my vndoing. The plot was laid, and I thus betraide where most I trusted; the time being come for the execution, the hired man (being mine more for iustnesse, then his for rewards) came vnto me, and vpon promise 29 of secresie discouered the truth vnto me, making me besides promise, to be perswaded by him; which was, for some time to retire my selfe, till a party were made in the Countrey strong enough to pull downe his pride, who had gained such power, as he was grown more powerfull then my selfe, then might I be my selfe, and rule in safety. I consented to the concealing, but neuer could be wonne, to thinke of harming him, whose vngratitude I be|leeu'd sufficiently would one day burden him. But how often did I entreat and beseech him to performe his part, and satisfie his Master in killing me? whose falsenesse and wickednesse more grieu'd me, then ten deathes (could I haue suffer'd so many) yet his honest car[...] ouer-ruled me, and I submitted to his Counsel. Then tooke he my clothes, apparelling me fit for the change of my fortune: He, (poore man) returning to my Castle, for so till then it was, credibly reporting, that I going to swimme, as often I did in this sweet Riuer which runnes along this Valley, I was drown'd (wee being then in that place, and indeed, the sweetest in the world.) This in some kind was true, said he, for drown'd I was in sorrow and teares: which, could they haue made a streame for bignesse answerable to their swift falling, had que|stionlesse made his fram'd report true. This being told the Duke, as then by my imagined death, imaginarily he was, did make shew of insupportable griefe being so possest, as he seemed dispossed of senses, furiously, and sud|denly stabbing the good man, who for my life lost his owne: This was coun|ted a passionate act, Loue transporting him so much beyond himselfe, as he was not able to resist his owne furie, while his deuillish cunning did both set a Glosse vpon his brutishnesse, and keepe his Treason vnreueal'd: the poore soule falling dead at his feet, while he said, take this for thy detested newes bringing. Then did he make a solemne funeral for my dead mind, though liuing bodie, He apparrell'd himselfe, and his Court in mourning, which gaue much content to the people who loued me, while indeed, their black was but the true picture of his inward foulenes. My wife did presently retire to a house her selfe had built: but when he had (as he thought) suffici|ently plaid with the people, he began to exercise his authority, beginning with my wife, picking a quarrell to bereaue her of her estate, which he in short time did, turning her to seek her fortune: Patiently she tooke it, hauing yet some Iewels left her, she bought a little house in a thick and desart wood, where she was not long before I came vnto her, discouering my selfe to both our equall passions of ioy and sorrow. Priuatly we there continued many yeares; God in our pouerty giuing vs an vnexpected blessing, which was a daughter, who grew vp and serued vs; for a seruant our meanes would not al|low vs, though our estates requir'd it. Seuenteene yeares we thus concealed liu'd, but then, as ioies, so tortures will haue end; The Duke in all pleasure and plenty, I in miserie, and pouery. One day the young Prince accompanied with his most noble companion Amphilanthus, (who for the honour of Greece was bred with him) and many other braue young Nobles who atten|ded them, went forth to see a flight at the brooke; when after a flight or two the Princes Hawke went out at checke, which made them all follow her, and so long, as at the last (for rescue of my afflictions) they were brought to my poore abiding, which by reason of the farrnesse from the Court, and foulnes of the weather, (a sudden storm then falling) they accepted for their lodging: 30 which although so meane as could be, yet they pleased to like it, rather loo|king into my heart for welcome (where they found it) then into the mean|nesse of the place.
After they had refreshed themselues and discoursed freely with me, it pleased my Prince to say, that my estate and life, agreed not with my con|uersation: wherefore he would not be denied, but needes must know the truth; which out of obedience, more then desire, with heart-tearing griefe I discoursed to him. He gaue few words for answer, but commanded me the next day with my Wife and Daughter to attend him to the Court, which faine I would haue refused; foreseeing (that which soone after [...]ol|low'd) the destruction of my once most loued friend: who, though hee had chang'd gratefulnesse to the contrary, and loue to hate, yet my affection could not so much alter it selfe as to hate where once so earnestly I affected, or seeke reuenge on him, whose good I euer wished. But we obeyed; then the sweet young Prince presented me to his Father, who instantly called me to minde, remembring many aduentures, which in our youths We had pas|sed together: pittying my fortune as much as he had in younger daies af|fected me, yet glad in some kind, to recompence my faithfull seruice to him; instantly sent for the Vsurper, who by reason of a iourney the King made to see his Realme, and shew it to his Sonne before his departure, who was to goe thence with his excellent Cousen in a search by them vndertaken, was come neere to the place of the Tyrants abode. He refused to come, but soone by force he was brought before the King; who with milde fashion, and royall Maiestie examined the businesse, which he confessed: but rather with a proud scorne, then repentant heart: wherefore the King with iust iudgement degraded him, committing him to a strong Tower, whereinto he was walled vp, meate giuen him in at the windowe, and there to ende his dayes: which were not long, pride swelling him so with scorne of his fall, as he burst and dyed.
The Dukedome after this sentence was restored to me: but truely, I was not able so to recouer my former losse, wherefore humbly thanking the King, and his Sonne, besought them to giue mee leaue to bestow it on my Daughter; which was granted me, my wife thinking she had seene enough when I was my selfe againe, departing this life with ioy and content. Be|sides, I made one suit more, which was, that since the Prince had with so much fauour begun to honour mee, it would please [...]im to proceed so far as to bestow one of his young Lords in marriage on my Daughter. The King and Prince both tooke this motion most kindely, wherfore choosing a hope|full young Lord, and him the Prince most loued, gaue him to her: the mar|riage was with much honour celebrated in the Court, at which for their vn|speakable honour, Parselius (for so the Prince is called) and Amphilanthus Prince ofNaples, were made Knights; and brauely for the beginning of their succeeding glory began those sports of Field, as since haue made them fa|mous ouer the world. This ended, I went away kissing the Kings and Prin|ces hands, vndertaking a Pilgrimage: which performed, I returned to this place, where like an Hermit still I liue, and will continue while life is in mee; this Valley, those sleepie woody Hilles, and the Caue I rest in, shall bee all the Courts or Pallaces that these old eyes shall euer now behold. As thus we 31 trauelled on, determining to conclude that daies iourney with the end of his story, and resting in his Cell that night, we were called from that resolution by a noise within the wood, of Horse, and clashing of Armour, which drew me to see what the matter was. Arriuing at the place, we found two gentle|men cruelly fighting, and by them many more slaine: but that which most amazed vs, was, that hard by them on the ground, was one of the Mirrours for beauty to see her selfe liuely in, so faire indeed, is she, and such a fairenes hath she, as mine eyes neuer saw her equall, if not that rare Shepherdesse by you, or the incomparable Lady Pamphilia, Sister to the noble Prince Parselius, who I need but name, the world being sufficiently filled with his fame. This Lady lay along, her head vpon her hand, her teares ranne in as great abundance, as if they meant to preserue themselues in making some pretty brooke of truest teares, her breath shee tooke rather in sighes and sobs, then quiet breathing, yet did not this alter the colour, or feature of her heauenly beauty: but resembling the excellent workmanship of some delicatly proportion'd fountaine, which lets the drops fall without hurting it selfe: or like a showre in Aprill, while the Sunne yet continues cleare and bright and so did she seeme to our eyes.
As we were admiring her, there came a Knight in blacke Armour, his Shield sutable to it without any Deuice, who not seeing the Lady, step'd to the two Combatants, willing them to hold their hands, till hee did vn|derstand the cause of their enmitie; They refusing it, turn'd both on him, one stricking him forcibly on the shoulder, he seeing their rudenesse, and feeling himselfe smart, forgot parting, and made himselfe a party, sticking one of them such a blow as made him fall dead at his feet. Whereupon the other yeelded, deliuering his Sword, and turning to the Lady, who now the Knight saw, with admiration for her fairenesse and sorrow, vnbinding her and sitting downe by her, finding I was likewise a stranger, call'd me, and the good Hermit to heare the discourse which the vanquished man deliuer'd in this manner.
Two of these which here you see lye slaine were halfe brothers, Sonnes to one mother; the one of them my Master; who on a day, after a long chase of a Stagge, happened into a Merchants house, not farre hence, where this Lady did then remaine: They were ciuilly and courteously entertained for being Gentlemen well borne, and in their fashion pleasing, they were respected, and belou'd of most; neuer hauing attempted, or to mans know|ledge imbraced, or let in a thought contrary to vertue till their comming thither, where they resolu'd of a course worse then man could of man ima|gine, if not proud by experience. For there they saw that Ladie, desir'd her, and plotted to obtaine her, purposing with all ill meaning to enioy her, nothing being able to giue other ende to their wicked mindes but this[...] whereto their beastlinesse, and true iustice hath brought them: hauing made this place their bed of death, as it was meant for their lasciuious de|sires. Great they did imagine her of birth, by the honour done vnto her; this was another spurre to their deuillish longing; yet to be certaine, with a good fashion dissembling their inward intent, (as well they could, for they were Courtiers) intreated the Merchant to tell who this Lady was, that they might accordingly honour and respect her. Hee told them her name 32 was Antissia, and that she was daughter to the great king of Romania, betrai|ed by her Guardian, taken from him againe by Rouers, and sold by them on this coast, at the Towne call'd S. Anzolo, where I a Merchant (said he) bought her; they not knowing who they sold, nor I what I had bought: till some daies after she her selfe (intreating me no more to suffer her to be made mer|chandize, but to carry her to her father, who would reward me sufficiently for my paines) told me the vnexpected secret. The brothers hearing this, inflamed more then before, beauty first inticing them, then ambition wrought to compasse a kings daughter to their pleasure; much commending them|selues for placing their loues so worthily, yet still forgetting how vnworthie and dishonourable their loue was. Desire makes them now politike, casting all waies how they might betray her; consulting together, they at last con|cluded, to get the Princesse into the Garden to walke, hauing before appoin|ted these slaine men to attend at a doore, which opened into the field, which they opening, perswaded her to goe out a little into so sweet an aire: she fea|ring nothing went with them, when no sooner she was forth, but shee found she was betrayd; crying for helpe would not auaile her, yet the pitifulnesse of it brought forth most of the house, who perceiuing what was intended and neere acted, no fury could be compar'd to theirs (and furie indeed it was) for they but fiue, and vnarmed, attempted to rescue her from vs, being all these; and two of them so amorous, as they in that raging passion (loue being at the best a mild frenzie) would haue been able, or thought themselues so, to haue withstood them, and many more, especially their Mistris being in pre|sence. This noise also brought forth the good woma~, wife to the honest mer|chant, where began so pitifull a monefull complaining betweene her and this Princesse, as truly mou'd compassion in all, my heart I am sure weeping for them: yet the mad Louers had sense of nothing but their worst desires. With these words the Princesse fell into a new sorrow, which the Knight perceiuing (whose heart was neuer but pitifull to faire Ladies) perswaded the sad Antissia so well, as he proceeded; Then being possest of the Ladie, my Master led the way, bringing his brother and vs to this banket; this place being set downe for her dishonor, but destin'd for their graues. Then grew a strife for the first enioying of her, so farre it proceeded, as from words they fell to blowes, and so in short time to this conclusion: for they fighting, wee following our Masters example, followed them in death likewise all but my selfe, and I now at your mercy. He had but concluded his storie, when I pul|ling of my helmet, kneeling downe to the Princesse, told her who I was, and likewise my search for her, which she (with as much ioy as on a sudden could enter into so sad a mind) receiu'd with gratious thankfulnes. Now had the black Knight in like manner discouer'd his face, which so excellent in loueli|nes, I cannot say fairenes, as the whitest beauty must yeeld to such a sweetnes; and yet doth his mind as farre excell his person, as his person doth all others that I haue seene, and so will all allow, for this was Amphilanthus; who with mild, yet a princely manner, told the Princesse, That she might leaue her sor|row being falne into his hands, where she should haue all honor and respect, and within short time by himselfe bee deliuer'd to her father. But first hee was to performe his promise to his dearest friend and Cosen Parselius in meeting him in Italy, the time prefixed being almost expired, and his search 33 vt[...]erly fruitlesse. But I pray sir (said Parselius) how came that braue Prince againe into Morea? By a violent storme (said he), wherein he suffer'd ship|wrack. This done, Amphilanthus, Antissia, the Hermit, and my selfe, tooke our waies to the Merchants house, whom we found return'd, but ready again to haue left his house, fill'd with discontent and passion for the vnhappy ac|cident: his wife in that desperate griefe as hardly could shee haue endured with life, had not the blessed returne of Antissia giuen comfort, like life vn|to her sorrowes. The seruant to the slaine Knight guided vs within sight of the house: but then with pardon and liberty of going his owne way, he de|parted.
That night we rested there, the next morning parted our selues; Amphilan|thus, Antissia, the Merchant and his wife, took their iourny together towards the Court, there to leaue her till he had found Parselius, and so end his vow; the old Hermit returnd to his priuate deuotions, my self took my way to the next port, to ship my selfe forRomania, in the same ship was also this man, who hearing me discourse of my aduentures with the Master of the ship, gaue ill language of Amphilanthus, then of Parselius, saying, they were Co|soners, and not Princes, but some odde fellowes taking good names vpon them, since it was very vnlikely so great persons should be so long suffered abroad, and trauell in such a sort alone, and more like runne-awaies, then Princes. These much moued mee: but to put mee quite out of patience, hee went on, giuing vilder, and more curst speeches of my owne Lord: this made mee strike him, and so wee fell together so close, as one or both had dyed for it, had not the company parted vs; and after wee had againe gon to it, but that this ship came and tooke vs, and so made vs Priso|ners to saue our liues. But now Sirs, if you doe not iustice, you wrong your selues, in not reuenging so great an iniurie done to the brauest Prin|ces.
Parselius replide: Wee were not worthie to liue, if wee did not right so worthy a Gentleman as your selfe, and reuenge the wrong done to so great Princes, whose greatnesse yet cannot keepe ill tongues in awe suf|ficientlie, but that in absence they are often wronged; and therefore friends must reuenge that, which they ignorant of otherwise may suffer. But herein wee may bee thought partiall; for this Knight you see is Le|andrus, my selfeParselius, one of the cousoning Princes (as it pleased his honestie to call mee): I would aduise therefore, that this rare Shepher|desse should appoint him his punishment. The young Knight kneeled downe to haue kissed the handes of the two Princes: they taking him vp, gaue him thankes for his discourse, commending him much for his loyaltie and valour.
Vrania, (who was as heartily angry as the Knight) seeing her Parselius thus wronged, could find no lesse punishment for him, then death. But then the Prince did with sweete perswasions mitigate her furie: but brought it no lower then to publike whipping, submission, and recan|tation: Lastlie, humbly on his knees to aske pardon of the Romanian K[...]ight.
All now satisfied but Vrania, (who could not easilie forgiue an in|iure done to her other selfe) sent him a shore to the next land they saw, 34 Then did the knight againe speake: My Lord Parselius, with your leaue, I be|seech you permit me to take so much boldnes, as to beseech my Lord Lean|drus to doe me so much honour, as to tell mee the aduenture, which caused the report and suspition of his death: they both agreeing, Leandrus thus be|gan. After I had left you most noble Parselius, I went to my owne countrie to visite my father, where still I heard the noise of Antissia's losse, the likeli|hood of her beauty, the griefe of Parents, and the wrong done to my selfe: these did not only inuite, but command me to be diligent, in making al these pieces ioyne again in the first body of co~tent; which I perswaded my self able to doe, by seeking and finding of her. The one I resolu'd, the other I nothing doubted: then with my fathers consent I left Achaya, taking my way among the Greek Ilands, and passing the Archipelago. I left no Iland that had a league of land vnsought, or vnseene: then shipt I my self, and past into your Morea; so after I had seene all those places, I went againe to [...]ea, resoluing afterwards to take towardsItaly, whither for farnesse it might bee the traytors had carried her; my companion then leauing me to go to his heart, which he had left in Cecillia. But being in the Iland of Cephalonia, there was a solemne and magnificent Feast held, which was by reason of a marriage betweene the Lords daughter of that Iland, and the Lord of Zante'ssonne, a fine and sprite|full youth; Iusts, Tilt, and all other such warlike exercises being proclaimed. Hearing this, I would needs shew my selfe one, as forward as any stranger to honour the Feast. The first day (which was the wedding-day) Armes were laid aside, and only dancing and feasting exercis'd: after supper euery one preparing for the dancing againe. With the sound of trumpets there entred one in habit and fashion like a Commander of horse, who deliuer'd some few lines to the new married Paire, dedicated as to their honour and ioy, which they receiu'd most thankfully, promising freedome and welcome to the whole company. Then entred in twenty Gentlemen presenting souldiers, and so danced in their kind, making a braue and commendable demonstrati|on of Courtship in the brauest profession, honour abounding most, where noblenes in valour, and bounty in ciuilitie agree together. After they went to a rich banket: the braue Masquers discouering themselues, were found to be gentlemen of both Ilands, equally diuided in number, as their affections ought to be to either, and therefore had put themselues into the euenest and perfectest number often, and ten. But to leaue sport, and come to earnest; the manner of that place was, that from the banquet the Bride must be stolne away (to bed the meaning is), but she tooke to the fields. Most did misse her, for there wanted no respectiue care of her, but al were satisfied with the fashi|on, correcting such as spake suspiciously, and expecting to be call'd to see her in bed, waited the calling. But the time being long, some hastier then the rest went to the chamber, where they found she had not been. This was instant|ly blowne abroad; all betooke themselues to Armes who could beare any, the Ladies to their teares, euery one amaz'd, and chiefly the Bridegroome perplext. The old fathers vext, the mothers tore their gray locks, such dis|order in generall, as cannot bee exprest, but by the picture of thesame acci|dent, Some mistrusted the Masquers, but soone they clear'd themselues, putting on Armes, and being as earnest as any in the search. I a stranger, and louing businesse, would needs accompany them (which the fauour of a 35 Nobleman, with whom I had got some little acquaintance, did well aide me in) whose fortunes were in finding them, more happy then any others, ouer|taking them, when they thought themselues most secure, being together laid within a delicate Vineyard, a place able to hide them, and please them with as much content, as Paris felt, when hee had deceiu'd the Greeke King of his beautifull Hellen; laughing at the fine deceit, and pitying in a scornefull fashi|on those, who with direct paine and meaning followed them, commending their subtilties and fine craftinesse, in hauing so deceiu'd them. Kissing and embracing, they ioyfully remain'd in their stolne comforts, till wee rudely breaking in vpon them, made them as fearefully rush vp, as a tapist Buck will doe, when he finds his enemies so neere: yet did not our comming any whit amaze them, but that they were well able to make vse of the best sence at that time required for their good, which was speech, vttering it in this man|ner.
My Lords (said they), if euer you haue knowne loue, that will (we hope) now with-hold you from crossing louers. We confesse, to the law wee are offenders, yet not to the law of loue: wherefore as you haue lou'd, or doe, or may, pity vs, and be not the meanes that wee too soone sacrifice our blouds on the cruell altar of reuenge, while we remaine the faithfull vassals of Ve|nus. Let not your hands be soild in the bloud of louers; what can wash away so foule a staine? You may bring vs (it is true) vnto our iust deserued endes: but then take heed of a repentant gnawing spirit, which will molest you, when you shall be vrg'd to remember, that you caus'd so much faithfull and constant loue, to be offred to the triumph of your conquest, ouer a louer vn|arm'd, wanting all meanes of resistance, but pure affections to defend himself withall, and a woman only strong in truth of loue. For my part, she wan me, my companion was by him gaind; so as promising assistance in place of arms, and helpe in stead of force, we sat down together, he beginning his discourse in this manner.
To make long speeches, striuing to be held an Orator, or with much de|licacie to paint this storie, the time affoords not the one, our truth and loue requires not the other; wherfore as plainely as truth it self demands, I wil tel you the beginning, successe, and continuance of our fortunate (though crost) affections. I lou'd this Lady before she had seene this yong Lord, she likewise had onely seene my loue, and onely tide her selfe to that, before he saw her; loue made me her slaue, while she suffered as by the like authoritie. I sued, she granted; I lou'd, she requited; happinesse aboue all blessings to bee im|braced. Our eyes kept iust measure of lookes, being sometimes so inchain'd in delightfull links of each others ioy-tying chaine (for so wee made vp the number of our beholdings), as hard it was to be so vnkindly found, as to sepe|rate so deare a pleasure. Our hearts held euen proportion with our thoughts and eies, which were created, nursed, and guided by those, or rather one harts power. But Parents hauing (were it not for Christianity, I shuld say) a cruel & tirannical power ouer their childre~, brought this to vs disastrous fortune: for discouering our loues, set such spies ouer vs (scorning that I being the yonger brother to an Earle, should haue such happinesse, as to inioy my Princesse) as we could neuer come to enioy more then bare lookes, which yet spake our true meanings after it was discouer'd. This course inrag'd vs, vowing to haue 36 our desires vpon any termes whatsoeuer, alwaies consider'd with true no|blenesse, and vertue. Thus resolu'd, We continued, till her Father con|cluding this match, shut her vp in a Towre, wherein he then kept (in her) his choisest Treasure, till this day of her Marriage: which opportunity we tooke, purposing; More he would haue said, as it seemd, truely to ma|nifest the vertuous determination they had, in their accomplishment of their desires, when he was hinder'd by the rushing in of others with their Horses. Rising, We discern'd the deceiu'd youth with some others in his company; Fate, like his Loue, hauing guided him to that place. In charity wee could not leaue our first professed Friends, nor could I part my selfe from such and so true Loue: wherefore resolutely taking my companions part, defended the Louers, pitty then taking the place of Iustice in our Swords; the Hus|band being vnfortunately slaine by my Companion, truly I was sorry for him, and glad it was not I had done it. But soone followed a greater and more lamentable misfortune: For one of the yong Lords Seruants, seeing his Master slaine, pressed in, vnregarded, or doubted, vpon the vnarmed Lo|uer, who was this while comforting his Mistris, and not expecting danger, was on the sudden thrust into the backe, as he was holding his onely com|fort in his armes. He soone (alas, and so foreuer) left his deare imbrace|ment, turning on him who hurt him, repaying the wrong with giuing him his death: but then soone followed his owne, the wound being mortall which he had receiued, yet not so suddenly, but that he saw the destruction of his enemies. We being as fierce, as rage, and reuenge could make vs, then he remaining alone (besides my selfe) aliue, and yet dying, giuing me in|finite thankes for my loue, and willing rescue lent him, with many dolefull and (in affection) lamentable groanes and complaints, he tooke his leaue of his onely and best beloued, then of me; to whom he committed the care of her, and his body, then kissing her departed. But what shall I say of her? imagine, great Prince, and all this braue company, what she did; You will say, she wept, tore her haire, rent her clothes, cri'd, sobd, groand; No, she did not thus, she onely imbraced him, kissed him, and with as deadly a palenesse, as death could with most cunning counterfeit, and not execute, She entreated me to conduct her to the next Religious house, where shee would remaine till she might follow him. I admird her patience, but since more wonder'd at her worth. O women, how excellent are you, when you take the right way? else, I must confesse, you are the children of men, and like them fault-full. The body we tooke with the helpe of a Litter which passed by (hauing before conuayd a hurt Knight to the same Monastery next to that place) and in that we conuayd it thither, where we buried him, and almost drownd him in our teares. Thinking then to haue remou'd, she fell ill, not sicke in body, but dead in heart, which appear'd; for within two dayes she dyed, leauing this world, to meet, and once more ioy in him, who more then a world, or ten thousand worlds she loued, and still desi|red; which made her choose death being her then greater ioy, burying them together a little without the house (the order of that place not per|mitting them to be layd within it.) After this sad (but honest) performance of my word, I went on in my Iourney, meeting within few dayes after, a Page belonging to my dead friend, who with his Masters Armour followed 37 him, loue and obedience bringing it into his mind. The armor was good, be|ing that which I now weare, mine owne hackt and cut in many places. With much sorrow the youth receiu'd the wofull tidings of his Master, then obtai|ned I so much, as to haue those armes, which with viole~t sorrow he consen|ted to, helping me to arme my selfe in them, though so, as had I been any but his dead Lords friend, he sooner and more willingly would haue wound in|to his funerall shirt. He tooke my armour, and laid it together vnder a tree which grew in the mid'st of a faire and pleasant plaine: then (although a|gainst my will) he kist my hands, and with as much true-felt sorrow as could lodge in so young yeares, tooke his leaue of me; only beseeching me, when I remembred my vnfortunate friends, I would also with some pity thinke on his misery: this was my aduenture. And then past I by sea, till on a rock I suf|fered shipwrack, being taken vp by this famous Pirat whom you so valiantly haue slaine, being I assure you, none of your least victories, he hauing had as much strength and skill, as in any one man need remaine: but knowing me, and some power I haue with the king ofCecile, my deere and worthy friend P[...]rissus his Vncle, whose excellent company I gain'd in Achaya, he then be|ing there, and with whom I trauelled many moneths, almost yeares, till I be|gan this search: this man, on condition I would mediate for him to the King, or his Nephew, let me goe at libertie, and arm'd in his ship, till such time as we fortun[...]d to land; alwaies concluded, that while I was with him, I should defend him with my best meanes. This made me resist you till heauen told me my error, which I repent, and heartily aske pardon for: and this sure was the reason that my Page imagined my death, if hee found (as by all likeli|hood he did) my armes.
Then did Parselius againe imbrace Leandrus: turning to the Squire of Am|philantus he demanded what he knew of his Master. Truly (replide he) no|thing but the ioy I conceiue to heare by this gentle Knight that he is liuing: I parted from him in a great storme, hauing been in Germany sent thither with an army from the Pope to assist the Emperour against the Duke of Saxony, who was slaine by his hand, and for this act was by the Emperour and the o|ther Princes made King of the Romans, hauing protected the Empire against such an enemy; since till now neuer hauing heard newes of him: but he ment to seeke still for you, and therefore left Germany, and in the Mediterran sea, my selfe, ship, and all my Lords treasure was taken by this Pirat, whom your valour hath destroyed. Thus with prosperous wind and infinite ioy for Am|philanthus his new title and hon[...]ur, they sailed towards Italy, hoping to land not farre from the Towne where the king of Naples at that time kept his Court, which was at that great Citie: but being within the sight of the shore because it then was euening they resolu'd not to land till the next morning, and so take the day before them. This thought the best (like mens counsells) proou'd the worst; for in the night rose a terrible and fearefull storme, being so violent, as it tooke not away rest only, but knowledge from the Pilot, be|ing onely able within some howers to assure them, that they were far distant from Italy. The tempest continued in as great (i[...] not greater) furie, nor any more comfort had they, saue that now they enioyed light, and yet could that light scarce be counted day, being but as day-breake before the Sun-rising; so as it was but as to distinguish the time of day from night, or as if it were to 38 hold a candle to them, the more to see their danger, so thicke, cloudy, and vn|comfortable, as they could discerne nothing, but what was nearest them, which was perill. Cunning now preuail'd not, for the most skilfull confessed, that now he was artlesse, heauenly powers working aboue the knowledge of earthly creatures, which way they were by force carried, was vtterly vn|known to them; sailes, tackling were gone; the mast, either by force, or hope of safety cast ouer-board; thunder, lightning, wind, raine, they wanted not; none being able to expresse the desperatenes of this storme, but by saying, it was the picture of the last day for violence, but like the world for strangenes and vncertainty. Thus they continued in the day (hauing only the shadow of a day) and in the night feareful flames, which yet they thankt, because by the~ they could discerne themselues. When heauen did think this storme had last|ed long enough crosse to those, though cros[...], yet still most louing louers, it commanded the seas to be at quiet, which being perform'd, the Pilot againe began to vse his skil, which first had meanes to let him know, that so farre they were from the place resolu'd on, as in stead of the coast of Italy, they were within sight of the Iland of Ciprus: this not onely amazed them, but much troubled them, considering the barbarousnes of the people who there inhabi|ted, and their extremity such, as of necessity they must land to replenish their wants, caused by the rigor of the tempest: yet were they come to such a part of the country, as there was no harbor or port to ride or land at; wherfore they were forst to coast the country; night again like an euil spirit possessing them, almost all tired and weary with the length and violence of the storme. Some were laid down to see if rest would possesse them: others falne asleep, none enduring it like the excellent Vrania, which brought comfort (though in sorrow) to the louing and nobleParselius, neuer shewing feare or trouble: incouraging all. And yet she did feare, but seeing his, she dissembled hers, in care of not further harming him, She, I say, when all were gone to rest, stood as Sentinel, but by her owne appointment, loue co~manding her soule to take no aduantage of restfull houres; which she obediently did, sleep neuer but by loues liberty possessing her eies: which freedome her passion had not yet al|lowed her, but molesting her patient sweetnes caused her to walke vp and downe in the maze of her trouble. The Moone (though coldly) smiling on her, and her loue[...] she perceiued a great fire, whereupon she called the compa|ny, demanding what their opinions were of it; they could not giue her a di|rect answer, till being come somewhat neerer, they pereeiued it was a Ship was falne a fire in the midst of the Sea, and right against it a very good Har|bour. Pitty, and noble compassion straight moued in them, so as they haled to the burning Barke, to know if there were any by ill fortune in her, and if so, to succour them, but hearing no answer, they concluded shee was empty: wherfore passing on they landed in the Island, which no sooner was done, but their former wonder was encreased, by the sudden falling a fire of their own Ship, which had but deliuerd her self of the~, and then as a Martyr suffer'd for the paine they had in her endur'd. But this past, admiration brought new sor|row to them, considering they were in a strange Country, among barbarous people, depriu'd of all hope to get thence any more, but there to continue at the mercy of vnchristened creatures. Parselius wished, but stil found himselfe further from succour of any but his fruitles wishes: all his tormenting griefe 39 being for Vrania. Vrania did as he did, iustly requiting his paine, for all hers was for him. All lamented and pittied Vrania, and the dainty Selarina, who mildly, yet with a more Woman like manner [...]uffered these afflictions, lo|uing and pittying Vrania, being an obligation they were all in their hearts, as they found, bound vnto. Leandrus sorrowed for her, and bewail'd the two young Princes, whose Father had lost his Kingdome, for his loue to his Father, which stirred in him a commiserate passion. Thus, all for others grieued, pittie extended so, as all were carefull, but of themselues most care|lesse: yet their mutuall care, made them all cared for. Parselius with a braue courage, at last aduised them to go[...] on, yet left it to their owne mindes, fearing to perswade, least harme might after follow, grieue, feare, perswade they did and all distractedly, so much they feared, and most was for Vrania: so much can worth, sweetnesse, and Beautie worke in noble mindes. His aduise was to goe on, and this was allowed, for what could hee propound thatVrania liked not of? And if she consented, what spirit could deny? Thus, on they went (but as in a Labyrinth without a thrid) till they came within sight of a rare and admirable Pallace.
It was scituated on a Hill, but that Hill formed, as if the world would needs raise one place of purpose to build Loues throne vpon; all the Coun|try besides humbly plaine, to shew the subiection to that powerfull dwel|ling. The Hill whereon this Pallace stood was iust as big as to hold the House: three sides of the Hill made into delicate Ga[...]dens and Orchards: the further side was a fine and stately Wood. This sumptuous House was square, set all vpon Pillars of blacke Marble, the ground paued with the same. Euery one of those pillars, presenting the liuely Image (as perfectly as caruing could demonstrat, of braue, and mighty men, and sweet and de|licate Ladies, such as had been conquer'd by loues power: but placed there, as still to mainetaine, and vphold the honour, and House of Loue. Com|ming towards it, they imagined it some Magicall work, for so daintily it ap|pear'd in curiositie, as it seem'd as if it hung in the ayre, the Trees, Fountains, and all sweet delicacies being discerned through it. The vpper Story had the Gods most fairely and richly appearing in their thrones: their propor|tions such as their powers, and quallities are described. As Mars in Armes, weapons of Warre about him, Trophies of his Victories, and many demon|strations of his Warre-like God-head. Apollo with Musicke, Mercurie, Saturne, and the rest in their kind. At the foote of this Hill ranne a pleasant and sweetly passing riuer, ouer which was a Bridge, on which were three Towres: Vpon the first was the Image of Cupid, curiously caru'd wi[...]h his Bow bent, and Quiuer at his backe, but with his right hand pointing to the next Towre; on which was a statue of white Marble, representingVenus, but so richly adorn[...]d, as it might for rarenesse, and exquisiten[...]sse haue beene taken for the Goddesse her selfe, and haue causd as strange an affection as the Image did to her maker, when he fell in loue with his owne worke. Shee was crownd with Mirtle, and Pansies, in her left hand holding a flaming Heart, her right, directing to the third Towre, before which, in all dainty [...]iches, and rich delicacy, was the figure of Constancy, holding in her hand the Keyes of the Pallace: which shewed, that place was not to be open to all, but to few possessed with that vertue.
40 They all beheld this place with great wonder, Parselius resoluing it was some Enchauntment; wherefore was the nicer how they proceeded in the entring of it: while they were thus in question, there came an aged Man, with so good a countenance and graue aspect, as it strucke reuerence into them, to be shewed to him, by them. He saluted them thus: Faire company, your beholding this place with so much curiosity, and besides your habits makes me know you are strangers, therefore fit to let you vnderstand the truth of this braue Building, which is dedicated to Loue. Venus (whose Priest I am) thinking her self in these latter times, not so much, or much lesse honour'd then in ages past, hath built this, calling it the throne of Loue. Here is She dayly seru'd, by my selfe, and others of my profession, and heere is the triall of false or faithfull Louers.
Those that are false, may enter this Towre, which is Cupids Towre, or the Towre of Desire: but therein once inclosed, they endure torments fit for such a fault. Into the second any Louer may enter, which is the Towre of Loue: but there they suffer vnexpressable tortures, in seuerall kindes as their affections are most incident to; as Ielo[...]sie, Despaire, Feare, Hope, Longings, and such like. The third which is guarded by Constancy, can bee entred by none, till the valiantest Knight, with the loyallest L[...]dy come together, and open that gate, when all these Charmes shal haue conclu|sion. Till then, all that venture into these Towres, remaine prisoners; this is the truth. Now if your hearts will serue you aduenture it.
They thanked the old man for his relation, but told him they had some Vowes to performe first: which ended, they would aduenture for impri|sonment in so rare a prison. The old Priest left them, and they weary, laid them downe neere the Towre of Desire, refreshing themselues with some little meate, which Vranias mayde had in her Scrip: but wanting drinke, they all went to the Riuer, whereof they had but drunke, when in them se|uerall Passions did instantly abound.
Parselius forgot all, but his promise to the dead King of Albania, for the setling his Sonnes in that Kingdome.Leandrus afflicted with the losse of An|tissia, must straight into Morea to finde her, and take her fromAmphilanthus; Steriamus and Selarinus would not be refused the honour of Knight-hood, Mars hauing so possessed them with his warlike disposition, as worlds to their imaginations were too little to conquer, thereforeAlbania was already wonne. Vrania, whose heart before was onely fed by the sweet lookes, and pleasing conuersation of Parselius, loues him now so much, as she imagines, she must try the aduenture, to let him see her loyalty is such, as for his loue, and by it she would end the Inchantment. Selarina, thought she saw within the Gardens, a young Prince with a Crowne vpon his head, who beckned to her, wherefore she would goe at such a call. Vrania's maide beheld as she beleeu'd Allimarlus in the second Towre, kissing and embracing a Black|moore: which so farre inraged her, being passionatly in loue with him, as she must goe to reuenge her selfe of that iniurie. These distractions carried them all, as their passions guided them. Parselius hauing knighted the two Princes, tooke their way to the next Port: Vrania now not seene or thought on. Leandrus hasting another way, to finde meanes for his Iourney. Selarina to the Towre, and knockt with that feruent desire to accomplish her ende as 41 the gate opened; all the three rush'd in, [...]triuing who should be first. But Se|larina was then soone made to know shee should not contend with Vrania, wherefore she was lockt into the first tower, burning with desire to come to that sweete Prince, which still she sees before her: hee calling, shee with vncessant desire striuing to goe to him. Vrania went on, when entring the second tower, guarded by Venus, she was therein inclosed, when as thus much sense came to her, as to know she had left Parselius, which strak her into a mourning passion, confessing that, an vnpardonable fault, and what he in iu|stice [...]ould not excuse. Then despaire possest her so, as there she remaind, lo|uing in despaire, and despairing mourn'd. The shepherdesse her seruant con|tinuing her first passion got into that Tower too, where she stil saw her afflic|tion, striuing with as much spitefull iealousie, as that fury could vex her with|all, to come at the Moore to pull her from her knight. Thus were the women for their punishment, left prisoners in the throne of Loue[...] which Throne and punishments are daily built in all humane hearts. But how did the honest Al|limarlus carry himselfe in all these changes? Alas, with much griefe [...]nd sor|row for this misfortune, he not hauing drank, being the on[...]ly sensible man left; wherefore fearing more the harme of Parselius and his companions then the Ladies, who were (without question) safe, though farre from being[...]ree, he followed them, lest harme might from those furious humors grow. They made such haste, as no rest could inuite their stay, till they were tired with their owne minds trauell, and then all three lying downe in one anothers armes, they yeelded vnto sleepe. In which, new torments vexed them: for then did they come a little to themselues (or a little more from themselues in another kind) and as men long held in a trance, awaked. Parseliuswee|ping for Vrania's vnkindnesse, who had (as hee dreamed) forsaken him, and left him sleeping, while shee went with another. The two Princes be|wailing the death of their Sister, who they imagined taken violently from them, and sacrificed to Venus.
Thus they againe fall into strange and new distractions, which grieu'd the young Knights verie soule to see, but hauing no hope of seeing them restored, while they continued in that Iland: soothing them vp in their owne opinions, knowing it dangerous and idle to crosse mad men, with gen|tle peswasions gain'd Parselius to goe with him, when hee promis'd to bring him where Vrania with her new friend did abide, and then he might recouer her, and kill his enemie. The other hee likewise gaind, promising they should haue the meanes to kill their aduersaries likewise.
Thus he got them thence: trauelling in this sort, till they came to the sea side where they found a small Barke, and in her two persons, an old man, and a little Boy being Fishers[...] and hauing taken some, had then newly put a sho[...]e to dresse, and so to satisfie their hungers with their gaine. The Romanian Knight saluted the old man, intreating, that that companie might goe into his boate, and time it was to preuent the com|ming harme, for then were they ready to r[...]nne into the sea; but by force they got them into the Barke, where no sooner they were, hauing freed themselues from the land (which was the nature of those charmes), but their good spirits againe possess'd them. Then did Parselius bewaile Vrania, crie out of his miserable fortune in hauing lost her, beseech euery one to pitie with him so great a mischiefe. The knight wept to see these 42 changes, but then mildly told him all that had happened. Grieu'd Parse|lius did remaine; but considering heauenly powers had caused this, he the more quietly endur'd it, yet not without a bleeding hart, and often showring eies: O Vrania (would hee cry), how iustly maist thou hate me, for leauing thee? Damn'd country, can it be that thou wert ordain'd for loue to haue a Throne in, and yet to be the hel of louers? Much more he cri'd, and sorrow|ed out, while the old man had gain'd the knowledge of this aduenture from Allimarl[...]s, who was by him knowne, so as beseeching Parselius to lay by his mourning, or at least to giue eare to this story, said hee, which will encrease compassion, and passion in you; with that the graue old man began thus. La|mentation (braue Princes) is that which I must treat of; but first I must tell you, as one of the parts of this story; I am called Seleucius, brother I am to the king of Romania, Lord to this young knight: and thus from me (the most vn|fortunate of Princes) heare the wofull'st and most disastrous history, that euer Princely eares gaue attention to. I was brother, and somtime heire to this vn|happy king, being thought lost: but after found in such an aduenture of en|chantment as this seemes to be. Return'd, married, and was blest with two children, of whom I am sure this Gentleman hath already discoursed vnto you, wherefore that part I wil leaue, and come to the last. My Nephew Anti|ssius being come from the fruitles search of his sisterAntissia, my brother would needs marry him to a Lady in the country, which he (although neuer hauing bin in loue) might haue questioned; yet he euer loued to obay his fa|ther, and so they were married. O Antissius, worthyAntissius: with that the teares ran downe his long white beard, resembling drops in snow, stopping his breat[...], that scarce the last word could bee heard. In this time did all the Princes ioyne, concluding it with sobs, and groanes, euery one hauing equall feeling of sorrow, though for seueral things. At last he cry'd out these words: Pardon great Prince this sad interruption in my story, which I am forst to do, heart-rending sorrow making me euer doe so, when I think of (much more name) my deerest Nephew, and his vnfortunate losse; being such a wound to that country, as none can imagine but our selues, who daily feele the misery. He being married by his fathers comma~d, who longed to see some fruit from so wor[...]hy a stock, his obedience hauing mastred his affection, which rather was to follow Armes, then fall into the armes of Loue: he worthily lou'd his wife, and louingly liu'd with her; within that yeare being blest with a Son, whom after his father they called Antissius: with this ioy'd-at birth began the ruin of all (yet not because of his birth, for in him we haue yet our last hope) but by reason that the Grandmother liu'd but to kisse her babe; after whose death the king again maried, and her, whose wickednes I am sure hath come vnto your eares. This malitious creature, after [...]he had caused Antissius to bee banisht and most honest men to lose their liues, or places, she yet not satisfi|ed with such sins, as neuer the earth sufferd in one body the waight of more; treason, adultery, witchcraft and murder, were plentifully in her, yet while he liu'd she was not contented. Wherefore to bring this to passe, was now her only study. In this time some one or two honest hearts were left, who gaue the king warning of her, ventring their heads to saue his body from harme; her immoderate desires so much knowne, as they cried out against her; shee being a Queene salued not, nor couered her sin, which in her greatnes appea|red the greater fault; a spot being more markt in a Diamond, then in an ordi|nary 43 piece of glasse. Long time it was ere his honest and vnspotted loue would belieue it, or hearken to it, while shee delighted her selfe in her owne shame, and his dishonor. At last ([...]hough extreame loath) he seem'd to see it, slaking his violent loue to her, & oft refraining her bed, made her discerne it, though delighting her self so much with others, had somewhat blinded her from see|ing, what but for policy, she cared little for. But then did shee neuer leaue the poore man with her flatterings and disfembling falshoods, till she had gaind the cause and ground of his most iust offence, and deserued mistrust, and vn|usuall strangenes, which at last (vndone by her bewitching fawnings) she gai|ned. Then had she enough, vowing to be reuengd on al, and vnder this colour to execute her malice, and purge her spleene vpon the famous Prince his son; which by her cruell practises, she at last vnfortunately brought to passe. For first (by meanes as she pretended that she was slandred) she got her good ho|nest husband to banish any, who had in the least, spoken of her lightnes; put|ting into that number those whom she hated, hauing suffred (as she alleagd) as much by their slanderous reports, as almost if it had been a truth shee had merited, wishing she had still continued widow, rather then to come to this height of honour; and hauing it, to fall so low as into the shame of dishonor: beseeching him throughly to reuenge her, or to permit her to retire to the most lonely and priuate life[...] rather then there openly to sinke vnder shame and infamie: or if she could be found faulty, then to cut off her head, farre vn|fit to liue wife to so vertuous and good a king. To satisfie her, whose dissem|blings were of force to bring new heate into his aged heart, which like old wood will presently kindle, he strooke off the heads of those loyall seruants, who had honestly (though vndiscreetly) told him of her sinne, men, not lo|uing that discourse of any. This done, he came to receiue thanks: but she tel|ling him this was nothing, and vnlesse hee would doe more to right her, so shamefully wrongd, she would go away, and execute some mischiefe on her selfe; her spirit and conscience not being able to sustaine themselues induring such abuse: and then (if euer he lou'd her) he would be sorry, he had wrongd so true and faithfully louing a wife, while he did credit pickthanking Coun|sellors. He seeing this passion in his deere wife, vowed reuengefull iustice on all she could accuse. Vpon this vow, and some other assurance which was giuen by execution, her holy Maiesty seem'd somewhat satisfied, and then conten[...]ed (as it were) to liue, hauing new life giuen in her iustice, and faith-trying honour. She came abroad, but oft-times blushing; modesty was the colour put vpon it, when indeed it was affection to a young Lord in the Court: who after shee found she could not win with all inticements and loue-showes, shee accused him for seeking her, and so with many more lost his head. Now was Antissius and his vertuous wife confind to a Ca|stle, some twenty miles from the Court, he being accused of popularity, and aspiring to the Crowne. This was the power of that insatiable Monster, as shee could, and would banish from him his best, and onely true com|forts. My Nephewes misfortune increasing, and his hate to liue, grow|ing euery day stronger in him, he gaind for all this the Queenes leaue to goe, and liue with me. She willing to it, hoping his former ill vsage would pro|uoke him to that hee might die for, else shee would finde a meanes to com|passe it. But few plots needed, this being the beginning, and his soone 44 following ouerthrow; for the people finding her gouernment absolute, and that being bent to the ruin of the land, followed the vertuous Prince in great numbers, and at al times, which he as much as in him lay, did put off & auoid: yet not so, but that the Queene wrought cunningly enough vpon it, to mixe iealousie with the fathers loue to his sonne, shee neuer ceasing to wish the subiects loue as great and firme to his Maiestie, as shee, and all others saw their hearts were placed vpon his worthy sonne, which though he for his af|fection to him, did not yet make vse of, yet it is a fine thing, said she, to bee a king, and a terrible matter to be tempted: were you not safely blessed with so honest a son. And therefore you must trust more to the loyaltie of Antissius, then the faith of his people, who, he might perceiue, regarded nothing lesse then their due respect to him. Sparingly she spake well of him, but freely to make suspition. Thus now was he falne into the path, which led to the court of her malice: for buzing these things in his old, and fearefull eares, shee at last brought to this fulnesse of ill. One day as she had appointed (being pri|uately with the King in a Gallery) two of the Counsell came in, in hast, yet a dissembling feare in their faces, counterfei[...]ing need, but doubt and vnwil|lingnesse to discouer what mou'd in them this sudden approch. The King vrg'd them, when with teares they told him, that they had gaind knowledge of a dangerous conspiracy, which was plotted, & to be instantly executed vp|on the persons of his Maiesty, and his most royal Queen, by Antissius and my self, the treason being this: to depose him, kil the Queen, banish the Counsell I make himselfe Monarch of Romania, dispose the offices, already disposed of, among his fauourites, and the whole realme, as he best liked to his followers, and associats, and in this kind make a conquest of it. Then alas sir (said they), what will become of poore Romania, when your vertue and wisdome shall be put by, their gouernment, and his greene capacity, and those young wild hea|ded Counsellors shall rule ouer vs, who were fitter at schoole to learne obe|dience and loyalty, then to sway a Scepter, besides the wrong and sin, of tak|ing the lawfull Prince from among his people. This related and seconded by the Queen, who stil in a double maner clear'd, & condemn'd poore Antissius, whose iust and vertuous heart neuer thought of such a treason, nor of her (if not with sorrow for her wickednes). It wrought so far in the iealous brest of the old man, as he manifested his crediting it, and with all the feare hee con|ceiu'd of it, expressing as much hate to his son, as such a wicked practise might iustly challenge. Then hastily (as feare is alwaies sudden) he demaunded ad|uice, with the best and readiest way to auoide the danger. They yet hauing gone but halfe way of their diuelish progresse, replied: That since it pleased him to haue such confidence in them, as to aske their aduice in so great a busines, they would as honestly discharge themselues, and this they held the safest, and the best course; which was, that the Prince (who they must still loue and reuerence, and whose fault cut their hearts to thinke of) should be sent for, but in such manner, as he should haue no cause to distrust, lest then he went about to gaine by force, what they before had been inform'd, he hoped to compasse by a priuate conspiracie. This aduice, and the plot it selfe, he im|parted to some more of the Counsell, who already were sufficiently instruc|ted in their parts, and so accordingly agreed; consenting, nay commen|ding the graue, carefull, and honest aduice of the other two. Then was a 45 Messenger straight dispatched to the Prince, (who like a braue, but innocent Hart came into the toile) with order to come himselfe, his wife, and So[...]ne vnto the King, whose age, and weaknesse being great, and his affection on|ly left strong in him, towards him, and his, would haue them neerer to him, and for that he would recompe~ce him, for the iniuries in former times done to him: I was not at home, for had I bin, the iourney surely had bin hindred, while Antissius doubting no treason, his noble heart being free from thinking any, in haste (hoping that way to expresse the ioy hee felt by these vnexpec|ted glad tidings) posted to the Court, leauing word, that I (who was to re|turne in a very short time after) should with all conuenient speed accompa|ny his wife, and sonne to the King. Few daies he had rid, before he was en|countred with a troope of horse, vnder the commaund of an ancient friend of his, and a friend indeed he was in this action, being betrayd as well as he, sent vnder colour of loue to the Prince, who since hee had (or at least it being thought hee had) so much dislik'd his father, as hee had forbid him his once heeld-deerest sight, and that the people had taken notice of it in a dangerous kind: to preuent any bold or hazardus attempt might happen by a rude mul|titude, the Queene had sent this troupe to guard him, and that she knowing the loue this Gentleman bareAntissius, had made choice of him to conduct his person thither. Antissius was somewhat troubled with this accident, won|dring why she should be on the sudden so kind, knowing th[...]t there was none whose ruin she and her godly crew more shot at: yet could not he (who saw only with the eies of vertue) pierce into this plot. Mildly and gratiously hee saluted the Captaine and his men, yet telling them, his innocency had been guard enough for his person.
They went on, but when they were within [...]ight of the great Citie of Constantinople (the Court then being there) they perceiued a farre greater number of Souldiers, with which sight hee saw his end, and soone heard he sentence of his death: for then did they set vpon him, crying, Downe with that Traytor, that disobedient child, the incurable griefe of his lo|uing father, the dishonour of our Countrie, and the Canker of the States quiet. With these cries they rushed violently vpon the Prince. The first troope seeing this Treason, did their best to defend Antissius; but their liues could not buy his safetie, in vaine striuing to alter destiny: the period of his dayes being come with a blow giuen him by a trayterous villaine, which strake his head in two. Griefe of this accident turn'd to fury, his party [...]ighting as if Antisius had beene in euery one, and so to bee defen|ded; but that was past, their loues onely liuing to him. Yet dyed it too, for none were left of the whole Troope, but the Captaine, and some tenne more. The Queenes men hauing gain'd almost what they sought, fully to giue her satisfaction in his death; yet wanted part, since they could not get his bodie, to be made a present to her cruelty. For the Captaine perceiuing their drift, hinder'd them of it, taking him vp when he saw the vnluky blow giuen, and in the heate of the [...]ight fled away with it, knowing this a bet|ter piece of seruice, then to haue lost his life in reuenge at that time: since to better purpose he might saue it in seruing his Sonne, to haue a iust, and fit requitall for such a wickednesse, on those shamefull murderers. They came with this body (of the most beloued Prince, while he liued, and the 42 most pittied and honourd after death) to my house. Iust as I return'd, did I encounter this sad and disastrous aduenture; In stead of a braue, coura|gious, and (with it) pleasing presence, I met his bloudlesse, pale, and mar|tyrd body. There I saw the hope of our Country, and comfort of mine age, chang'd againe into our first being: So much it afflicted mee, as I stood amazed with griefe, speechlesse, and senselesse of sense, but sorrow: till sorrow being pleasd to make me haue more feeling of her power, gaue me leaue to let these words come from me. O Antissius, hath life beene lent me to see this day! Miserable man, miserable Countrey, wretched age, wherein such cruelty doth raigne; O Antissius! but then by their honest good perswasions (telling me the necessity, and ensuing dangers, if not pre|uented, that the rest liuing might fall into) I stroue to endure this calamity with as much patience, as so miserable a man could let sinke into him, and in|deed for this young youthes sake, who is the young Antissius, heire to these miseries, and the ouerthrowne estate of Romania. But then followed a se|cond cause of griefe; For his vertuous wife came to vs, who hearing such lowd cries, and distracted noyses, left her Chamber, following the cries till they brought her to that most lamentable spectacle. When she saw the cause of their wailing, she put them aside, going to the body, and kneeling downe by it, vsed these words; My deare, was it for this, that vnnaturall Father, and monster of women, sent for thee? That no sooner thou shouldest see thy Fa|thers house, but with it thou must see thy house of death? Alas, wert thou too good, too hopefull, too full of all vertues to liue among vs, who can now but assist thee with our teares? But long shall not this worldly sorrow triumph ouer me in thy losse, for I must, and will be with thee; with that kissing the pale lips of her dearest loue, and as it were breathing her (though not last, but fortelling) last breath into him, she rose, and rising, a little seemed to smile, ioy within her (for assured going to him) hauing caused that Countenauce; which by some was disliked, not being, to their weake apprehensions, sad e|nough, for such a cause of woe. As soone as she had left the body, she came to me, earnestly entreating me, that I would suffer none to trouble her, shee hauing some priuate deuotions to performe, which being ended, I should be welcome to her. For my part, I so little mistrusted her intent, or imagi|ned a Woman had so strong a spirit, as to dye when shee would, granted what she asked, being confident, her goodnesse would keepe her from do|ing any violence on her selfe. Hauing left me, she went to the roome where her young Sonne lay, and then fast sleeping, when as weeping ouer him (as the Maides[...]ince tolde me) well maist thou sleepe, deare heart, said she, for long, I feare thy quiet will not last; thy being Sonne to so worthy a Father, and vnfortunate a Mother, must cast some stormes on thee, it being fault e|nough in thee to haue such Parents: at least, thy wicked Grandmother will thinke so, who hating truth will make thee suffer for thy Fathers sake. Sleepe then quietly, my sweet, and lost Antissius, nor now looke vp to see thy woefull Mother, or to take her last farewell: but thus re|ceiue her blessing, which as the blessing of her owne soule, shee wi|shes may come, and stay vpon thee, God sending thee a more happie life then thy valiant Father had: let his guifts of vertue, courage, and magnanimity liue in thee, and his misfortunes take their graue in mee; 47 Alas,Antissius, my onely sweet Babe, I must leaue thee, then againe kissing him, shee said. This is the difference in affection, twixt a Husband and a Childe, otherwise no feare of misfortune [...]hould carry me from thee, but my sweetest I must goe, leauing Antissius, to flie to Antissius. And good maids, said she, haue a kind, and iust care of this young Prince, he may liue to re|quite your paines, and reuenge the wrongs done to his distressed Parents. They vowed all faith and dutifull seruice to him; then againe, as loath it must be the last, she kissed him, and so went to her Chamber: yet at the dore, turning backe, affectionatly, and with watry eyes, cast her last, and kindest fare-well looke on him. When she came into her Chamber, Shee lockt the dore, not suffering any to stay or come to her: where she continued till (I thinking her stay long, besides, hauing businesse with her concerning the dead Prince) I went to her Lodgings, where long I knocked, and indeed, so long as it vexed me: but after feare possessed mee, when I considered what the danger might be, and her freedome, and liberty, such as none had euer receiued that dishonor, of being barr'd her presence. Wherefore I sent for some of my Seruants, who by my command brake open the dore. Entring the roome, We found her laid vpon her bed, newely dead, yet her owne accustomed sweetnesse in her, lying as straight, and vnmou'd, as if death had onely then showne, he could in his panges be milde, yet receiue his gaine: so as well it may be said, he depriu'd her of her life, yet left her owne beauty and grace to triumph ouer his fury. By the bed side stood a Ta|ble couer'd with a Carpet of Crimson Veluet, and on the board a Letter, which I tooke vp,

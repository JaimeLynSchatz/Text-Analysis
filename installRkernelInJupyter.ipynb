    "First, if you are doing this in OS X it is vital that you run all of this from R in your terminal. I would recommend the same if you are trying to do this in Karst. For Windows users, you can run this in the R app. If you need to download R go here: https://cran.r-project.org/ and download R. Once you have R downloaded open your terminal (for Mac users). If you do not know how to access your terminal, simply hit 'command' + 'space bar' and type 'terminal' in the resulting search box. Click on the terminal icon that appears and you should now see the terminal appear. To get R running in your terminal, simply type 'r' (minus the quotes) and hit enter. If you have R downloaded on your system it should start running. Next, input the following in your terminal:"

text Help Desk staff are absolutely wonderfulOnline wireless access is very spotty"-- School of Liberal Arts IT Support Staff ([IRD]) are a PRICELESS RESOURCE. They are unbelievably quick in responding to faculty concerns, are absolutely reliable, and manage a torrent of faculty requests with enviable patience. I honestly could not be as good at my job without their availability."Always a good experience.Always good."Always helpful, courteous, and patient.""At the instructor station in the computer lab where I teach it often takes about 10 minutes to log in and up to 20 minutes to access and set up a project in Visual Studio. At the beginning of the semester even though I reported a projector problem several days before the start of classes, it had still not even been investigated by the first day of class. Then it took several days to fix. Was not an easy fix. And there are problems almost daily with response times, printing, and Visual Studio freezing up. Sometimes the consultant can help, but often all he can do is send a trouble ticket."Better coordination between IU and IU Health systems."Communication is not always as good as it should be: changes in Canvas, for example, are not always announced with time to adjust to those changes and typically with good rationale for them (TaskStream come to mind; also the shift from Connect to Zoom)."Difficult to get help promptly.DUO - not needed for Canvas. A lot of bother for marginal improvement in security. Wastes a lot faculty time.BOX - not intuitive. Not easy to use with students. Limitations on uploads.Canvas - tied to BOX?? Limited upload capability. Hard to transfer complicated courses from one semester to the next and Canvas does not transfer many of the functions."I am an Apple user. Occasionally have difficulties with the Exchange, UITS cloud service changes not communicated. I use my own Apple in the classroom - the workstations in various classrooms and IUPUI student center are different, making plug-in a nuisance/problem when moving between rooms.""Need to pay attention to user needs and simplify and train - rather than force changes that are unwelcome (e.g. DUO). Do fewer things very well, rather than have lots of things that don't work well or very challenging to make usable (e.g. video recording in the classroom)."Make the in-class stuff easy to use - always a surprise when I need to occasionally use the windows system and find the programs that I need.We are the customer .... please help us rather than jam changes that require lots of time and effort on our part to implement and/or troubleshoot. Figure-out the total cost (including faculty time) in the changes that you have implemented. I spent countless hours converting to Canvas as well as lots of wasted time using DUO just to log into Canvas and Box ... and I still get all the phishing stuff.Everyone was very professional especially [IRD][IRD]Generally satisfied. "I'm not that happy with Box, however. I also use Dropbox (for free), and find that its implementation across platforms and file types just works better than Box, which often generates error messages during sync. Great to have access to the unlimited cloud space on Box, but I have never been able to get it to work on iOS, whereas Dropbox has been no problem."Helpline staff helpful when I phone in with laptop problems. I'm glad they are available weekends / evenings.Wi-Fi not adequate on campus. Duo is a headache. No walk-in service after hours -- or when the it building is closed. (Made a special trip to pick up a duo device but the building was closed.)Hire better people."I am satisfied with the services received. The knowledge base is a great resource that I always use in case I have any doubt. Besides, UITS has always given be a quick response whenever I have needed their help, either installing a new research or managing software or solving minor issues.""I find that the HELP desk staff are not particularly knowledgeable about some of the course management systems, like Canvas. I usually seek advice from staff at the Center for Teaching and Learning instead."I find them to be incredibly responsive each time I contact them."I have had - in the past, these seemed to be reconciled now - instances in which my needs (including access to necessary software and fixes to my computer) were delayed for months. Because every aspect of IT needs has to go through the IT services, and we are at the mercy of whomever to which we are assigned, small and large adjustments and needs are taken out of our hands. While I appreciate that there are many things I cannot and should not be able to do (I know I am not very tech savvy), basic updating and downloading administrative rights and the ability to circumnavigate assignments that are not working for academic time restraints must be in place. I have excellent experiences with support for Canvas and other in-the-moment 24/7 help items ([IRD] assistance has been excellent!!), but other long-term, time sensitive items such as SAS updates and rebuilding of motherboards and assists with unresponding usb-ports have been very frustrating.""In addition - there is a serious problem with Phishing and other concerning activities. Each time I have tried to utilize help or report an issue, I have been yoked in arduous ways in regards to documentation and otherwise, keeping me from reporting subsequent and future concerns. These processes need to be easy and ""report it/leave it"" for busy researchers and teachers. Having to become a detective to find out the problem in Phishing situations or Canvas problems defeats the purpose of turning to IT professionals.""I have had nothing but very positive interactions with UITS staff. Everyone has been very helpful, especially for non-techy people such as myself.""I rely on classroom technology to teach, and just this semester I have had to go without technology on at least two occasions. I also think faculty should be informed when Canvas is down so that before we enter the classroom, we have time to prepare adequately.""I think it's important to make sure IT services are always user friendly. e.g. I've found the Duo authentication a bit cumbersome at times for services that I use repeatedly - but overall I think it's been a pretty successful roll-out; it would just be nice to NOT have to authenticate, for example, on my personal computer repeatedly.""I wish that it were easier to get copies of MS Office as well as Visio, particularly if you have multiple personal computers. I have not tried Office 365 yet. MS student discounts are not very significant for expensive products like Visio. It should also be easier to get copies of operating systems. In general, IU does a good job providing resources, but these are areas that have become more restrictive over the years. Appreciate the ability to provide feedback. Thank you for everything that you do for us.""If there is any way to change the format of canvas email to a date based email rather than conversation, it would be very helpful. It is extremely difficult to search for emails in the current system."In general I have always found the UITS staff very friendly and helpful.I thought of 2 additional comments during the survey:"1) Saving data and output files in SPSS is very awkward - the default locations are not reachable from anywhere else (and maybe don't permanently store anything), and its very difficult to find a way to your own drives and folders. I have not tried cloud storage to see if it works better. It would be nice if a user could set up a default storage location the first time they use SPSS that activated each time that user accessed SPSS.""I recently used one of the Student terminals in the space between Psychology (LD) and Engineering (SL), and found the setup remarkably uncomfortable. I can't remember the exact problem; I think it was that I had to crane my neck upward to see the monitor. It was almost unusable.""My answer to the question about participating in a focus group is maybe. It would depend on when, how long, and the particular topic.""In my particular field, geography, we use remote sensing and geographic information system software extensively. We are one of the few research-oriented universities I know where having access to multiple software titles is not the norm or falls on departments or schools. Even more concerning, we have been in discussions with UITS personnel (myself and colleagues from IUPUI and IUB who also teach in these fields), and the level of support we have been receiving is on the decline. We had far better support and access when tech fees were retained by the school and these services were not managed centrally by UITS."It is becoming completely impossible to navigate your systems. I spend more time putting in passwords that I spend on teaching or work. You need to rethink your computer security methods."It is terrible having graduate students using Umail and staff using Outlook Exchange. It is extremely inconvenient that the two systems cannot be integrated and transitioning from a graduate student to staff was a major inconvenience in terms of e-mail, as I now have two university accounts with non-overlapping contacts that do not sync easily, as well as two calendars. It is a terrible system that seriously needs improvement."It would be nice to have better support for Mac. There are many Mac users on campus but much of the support seems to be focused on PC."It's clear that UITS is involved in a lot of services I use, and I appreciate that. One recommendation I would make is to enable my phone to be able to block spam calls."IU has very impressive IT infrastructure and support. It is much better than those at any of my prior institutions."IU SON IT has been and continues to be very responsive to my IT issues. My one main issue with UITS was regarding Box/Box Health. The primary owner of the account had left IU, and months after she had left, Administrators of the Account deleted it without informing any of the other active members of that account. It was restored for a few days and then disappeared. Fortunately, when it was available, I backed up all the folders. I had informed the technician, who was helping me at the time, that the account had disappeared (again). The easiest solution to restoring that account was for me to re-upload the files back to Box/Box Health."UITS is great and we are generally happy with their work. A few comments about areas of improvement: Kuali is an old system that should be decommissioned. Teleconferencing at IU is difficult. Wireless Internet works poorly. Working with Karst has been difficult: we decided to run our own cluster.I've had really good experiences with UITS for the few times I've had to use them.I've had some issues with having to wait in the evening for help that never appeared (a UITS supervisor learned of this and helped out the next day)."I've only had superb experiences with UITS, especially [IRD] who is an incredible person and asset to Herron School of Art and Design. I would like to see short UITS workshops offered to students at the beginning of every year. I had [IRD] give a talk to my senior class about general information and it was really helpful and improved the semester.""I've used UITS several times the past year. Twice the support person to whom I spoke on the phone was unable to help me with the issue and had to send the problem to someone on another level. Though I received a response from the next level, the response didn't resolve my issue either. I think there are some issues, particularly with Canvas, that haven't been resolved yet, and I am unaware of the conduit though which I would channel those issues. The phishing emails I receive, and there are several, look so real, they are hard to distinguish from legitimate emails; It might be helpful if those emails could somehow be made to look different. Having a repository of scams would only help if the scam had already been discovered. After the phishing email is open, it is too late."Keep up the good work! You all provide so many excellent services for IU IT needs. Small Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS) are going to start playing a prominent role in University research. We need to look forward and consider how to archive these geospatial assets."Methods must be identified and implemented to improve cellphone coverage in buildings where extensive teaching, advising and faculty interactions take place. The Van Nuys Medical Science Building is a prime example. The current home for Medical Student Education within IU School of Medicine as well as the Health Professions Program and IUSM Graduate School offices, is plagued by poor service from most carriers. This makes attending a meeting in this facility a hardship for the students, staff, and faculty (many of whom are volunteer faculty) who are unable to send or receive phone calls or messaging of clinical relevance during their time in the building. Solutions must be found ASAP."My interactions with UITS have all been positive."My office is located in the [IRD] of Taylor Hall and I have terrible cell phone reception. Also, the lower level of IT has bad reception. It would be very helpful if you could improve this."nano"No negative experiences. They've been helpful. Changing the phones so that the are not connected to the computer would be helpful, especially when calling in computer problems."noneOn-site person to help saved time and stress"Overall UITS is responsive to faculty needs, but I am very disappointed with the constant change in software support which seems to pervade the UITS culture. Over the past 2 years, we have routinely been in a rolling model of software implementation/retirement which makes managing our work more challenging than need be. In particular, I am very frustrated with the constant poorly announced CAITS changes to infrastructure, only to find out that this results in a breakage of dependent processes which are business critical to our radiology department. As one of the major PIs responsible for having to handle these poorly managed roll-out schemes, I wish they would perform testing on a development environment and then roll this out to production once they are sure this is viable. All too often new software infrastructure is rolled out and little to no forethought has been placed on how this will impact the faculty or staff members.""Overall, UITS' support services and support resources have been very valuable, useful and helpful in facilitating my work at IUPUI."Please make sure that Linux VPN access/clients are better supported and documented. I am not sure how to use Duo for my non-gui client (instead I do it through Windows and VM but that can be clunky and has other issues)."Positive, positive and positive! Your staff are lifesavers especially when they help us find a lost document at midnight! So true! I have always found your staff incredibly helpful for all of my questions.""I am in a unique situation in that I [IRD] on the IPFW campus, which is Purdue governed. Our systems do not communicate with one another well. I have problems at the IPFW campus that our generally outside the scope of UITS to help with. When they can help, they do. With more politics going on at IPFW, i.e., the split between IU and Purdue, I am actually hoping that things will improve and that we won't have to go through any of IPFW's (to become just Purdue) systems in the future. That would be great! They still use Blackboard for example, for their courses. Everything I do, I am essentially doing remotely from the IPFW campus, and that makes certain things challenging.""In general, I use UITS for support with software and I find them to be consistently amazingly helpful! Thanks for the great work that you do!""Support staff is always efficient, helpful and professional - I am very happy with them. ""The changes made recently regarding the outside log-in to IU and IU Health VPN networks are highly disruptive and render the log-in process almost impossible to use. To access patient information from home, I have to go through two-step log in to access IU VPN network followed by two-step log-in to access IU Health website, followed by log-in to Cerner. This is excessive and takes 5-10 minutes before the information can be accessed. ""Multiple software platforms are not interconnected and use multiple passwords/log-in processes. Synapse (radiology cloud services) does not work on most computers. To sign off on resident dictations, one has to log into an ancient 3M system that uses a different log-in process, forces Windows XP (!) window and fails to work on most computers.""Syncing iPhones has been an issue for me. I am overseas so I will contact UITS when I return. (My phone still shows emails that I deleted from my laptop in my inbox, etc.)"The internet service is down or inaccessible at times which is very inconvenient especially when time-sensitive work needs to be completed.The IT people I interacted with were very responsive and follow me until the ticket was closed.The survey is too long. You need to find a way to tailor questions for specific individuals. For instance questions about IT and research may not be relevant to a staff."The Wi-Fi in the Medical Science Building in Indianapolis is poor. Often it takes 5 minutes or more to connect to Wi-Fi on my phone while in my office, which delays my ability to complete the Duo link. While this may not seem like much of a wait time, it can be very frustrating as one is preparing information for classes on canvas or committees.""VOIP using Lync does not work, at all, in my office. Incoming calls never ring through and always end up in voicemail. Outgoing calls take a significant amount of time to get a dial tone, if I get one at all. There is no cell signal in my office, and so if I need to make an outgoing call I always go to my lab and use its phone."The Wi-Fi service provided by IUSecure is not very fast. Hope you can speed up the service."UITS provides quick service in my research lab, even for my MacBook. I'm very satisfied."The SIS system for HR and students is not as user friendly as most systems at IU. I think this system should be improved.UITS staff are fine.... Cerner is a poor system!You need to create surveys that are shorter as we don't have time for this!UITS staff generally very service oriented and high performing.UITS strategy sometimes veers into pursuing a technology agenda that veers from mission. There can be alignment that allows both technology and mission to excel.Updating the computers. etc. without letting instructors know is not a good idea; nor is the fact that [IRD] is frequently non-operational due to events the night before.UTIS service is reasonably prompt and is effective."We have had issues because we are off campus and used a microwave, which went down, and have had to work off a provider, which has meant slow speeds and inability to perform some work.""When there are shared resources between IU and IU Health, such as printers, it is not always clear how to solve problems that may be network related.""Work with Microsoft Office 365, do more with SharePoint and OneDrive."

UITS can help by leading the way and helping other units understand how easy it can be to use the services.""* The university needs a better contact list system. Able to search by name or tags such as school, function, department. Tie it into the annual contact/security updates that occurs via IUOne. "* KB needs and university webpages need better search engine.All good experiences. Nice job.All my issues have been resolved completely and in an efficient amount of time."Always a positive experience on the IU East Campus. [IRD] and the staff have excellent customer service skills. Cheerful, helpful and I would be lost without them."Always a positive experience. We usually work with [IRD] or [IRD] and they are very responsive and terrific to work with.Always helpful.Always very helpful."At this time, I do not have any comments, but I do like being kept updated about important improvements taking place with Technology Services."Before the fall 2016 we were offering technical support to our students in-house for the online Kelley Physician MBA program. We also published contact information for the UITS Support Center. I am the only technical staff in our department and it was becoming difficult to manage resources to support our 80 students. As of Fall 2016 we transitioned to recommending UITS (including a link to the KB) as the first point of contact for technical support and removed my contact information from our student resource list. The experience has been very positive for our students and it has freed up my time to focus on other technical aspects of the program. The Support Center is an especially valuable resource for our students who rely heavily on technology to complete their degree."Being forced to use my personal smartphone to use the two step log in is inappropriate, especially when sometimes the internet connection is not good and I have to use data to get on my phone. I use this to log into Kuali Coeus IRB and to use the VPN. Hard to access if I have forgotten my phone in the car or at home!!!! Why are we using our personal devices as required items for work?""Better integration/communication of IU Health IT and IU IT services. As a [IRD] located at University Hospital, I must use many services provided by IU Health (Cerner, Provation, fax/scanner services, etc.) which interconnects with my IU computer. When those systems fail, it is extremely difficult to get problem resolved because both IT departments don't communicate efficiently and holding one department responsible to correct is a challenge. Our IU IT staff does their best to help but many times meets resistance from IU Health IT."Every interaction has been positive."Every time I interact with the techs from the help desk, my needs are met. They are not only competent, but friendly and pleasant."Every time I try to connect my Outlook account on a new personal Windows device I have issues even though I follow the same steps and processes. The UITS support staff have always been helpful and thoughtful and have helped resolve my issues in a fairly timely manner. My one complaint/improvement would be to make new software on IUware easier to find. This is specifically regarding the Microsoft Office 2016 rollout. I had wanted to use the updated software and thought that IUPUI didn't have access as the primary link advertised was locked specifically to IPFW. There was another entry however for all other campuses that was inconveniently tucked away. One of the UITS techs had to show me which I was thankful for but frustrated that I could have had the updated software months before I did."Everyone I have encountered is very personable and customer oriented. The online references are not as friendly. Specifically, the DUO sign in for VPN users was very vague and hard to understand.""Generally, I find the UITS staff and services to be easily available and helpful. I occasionally visit the UITS help desk in the IT building and have found the people who work there to be responsive. One opportunity for improvement is for that desk to be staffed by two people more frequently. Sometimes the wait is long - more than 15 minutes. Another option is to call for back up help when more than one person is waiting for service."Hello. I've had very satisfying experiences with our IT dept. The dept. always responds to our needs whether it be hardware or issues with software concerns. They are considerate and don't make me feel foolish when I ask what may seem to them 'simple' questions. I believe they are stretched thin and would like to see additional people added to our building (Dental).Thank you for the opportunity to participate in this survey."Hi, I don't believe I have used UITS services. We have our own IT division in the Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences.""I am less familiar with the IUPUI UITS team more broadly, and have more experiences with the two person team in my department. I find their support to be substantively lacking...in professionalism, expertise, support and progressive theory for IT support. For example, every time we have an issue (which is often), they seem irritated to have to address it and often note that it's really not their domain, but a UITS domain (which I don't really understand). So, some shirking of responsibility. Also, it seems that the team is often encouraging us to use technologies that lighten their support load versus the technologies that actually fit our needs - downward management. Not satisfied at all with the pervasive and consistent issues we have with technology, and the lack of effective, collegial support we receive from the team here in our department."I am relatively satisfied with the services from UITS. HelpNet has been a godsend to this office. I can't thank them enough.I work with the ATAC in Bloomington. They have been awesome as well but need to take the much needed time off. It is ridiculous that people are working there 12 plus hours a day/7 days a week. We can do only what we can do.I would like to see more interaction with the UITS staff. I would like to be invited to the technology conference in Bloomington as it would only heighten my knowledge of what is available here at IU."I don't ever really deal with UITS...I did to set up my phone, but that was all. For work, I have to call CNC, and well that is always a problem as no one there knows anything about MACS and they openly admit that. Why let people in your department get machines to do their work on and then not know how to help them fix issues they have. AGGRAVATING!""I don't have many interactions with UITS, which I think speaks well of the general reliability of their systems.""I don't know if there is an overlap with CAITS vs UITS. I know I have to contact both for different issues. I will do my best to focus just on UITS, but please know that CAITS' reputation has a large impact on my opinions of IT in general.....and I don't feel like we have great service from CAITS. Some is good, but most of the time it is pretty frustrating."I don't use UITS services enough to be have suggestions.I have always had timely responses from IT services."I have been highly pleased with all of my interactions with UITS staff that has assisted me to set up specialized computer classes. [IRD] was very patient and flexible with us and worked hard to accommodate all of our needs, which was no easy task."I have experienced good turn around time for IT problems.I have had only positive experience with UITS."I have had very good experiences with IT staff. Always friendly and willing to work with me. One complaint-when multiple staff members are getting new equipment, please give everyone the same permissions and printers."I have not had any negative experiences with UITS. I particularly like all of the resource software available on IUware and instructional pages (Knowledge Base) for any technology troubleshooting."I have used UITS on several occasions and have been completely pleased. I called about an issue with my W-2 and spoke to a tremendously helpful young man who fielded my question professionally and reached out quickly to his supervisor to confirm one of the issues we discussed. So in terms of both tone and quality of service, I have been impressed. I've had other similar experiences."I have worked a lot with [IRD] and she has been great."I honestly deal mostly with our department IT (MMGE) who are able to solve my problems incredibly quickly, so I do not have much experience working with UITS. It has been fine every time I have, though!""I love that we have an UITS Help Desk in the IUPUI Campus Center. Great location, very convenient.""I rarely interact with UITS staff, maybe a handful of times since I started almost 5 years ago. I primarily interact with my IT person in the department.""Like most of the comments on one.iu, the Duo two step process is difficult and has been frustrating for co-workers since their workstations are not IU computers, but affiliate computers. They are currently unable to log in at their desk and must come to an IU station since the affiliate is unwilling to make changes to the computer. This wastes time and energy. Duo should have been tested on multiple browsers and versions. "I would also urge IU to consider expanding Google at IU to make it PHI compliant (as well as other applications). It is frustrating that most applications are not PHI compliant so research teams are left using REDCap or a Health Box. "Additionally, while a small item, it would be nice if you could numerically organize folders in Box without having to rename them. Right now, you must use 01, 02 if you don't want 21 to jump in front of 3, 4, 5 etc."I really do not have anything to add at this time.I really miss LYNDA...(https://www.lynda.com/)...Do you think we'll ever renew the subscription?I think a central location to identify possible phishing attempts would be a great idea."I think that the commitment to good service can be uneven at times as it concerns faculty facing staff. I have worked with individuals who strive to address issues, working hard to find answers to any solution. I've worked with others who decide that if they cannot immediately address a problem they drop the issue with faculty. "I wish we had more staff who were already or who were encouraged to be more curious and dedicated to finding solutions to problems or exploring what other units do so that they would know that the answer lies within UITS as it so often already does.I think these surveys are only intended to permit UITS to develop rebuttals because I have never seen an end user request implemented."I went to the UITS help desk to get help with setting some things up on a iPad my department gave me to use, and person there said they didn't help with those kinds of issues, only if a computer wasn't working, etc. After going to CTL, I went back to the UITS help desk and this time they person was a lot more helpful."I wish I had known the Research Technologies existed. "The Knowledge Base is incredibly extensive (and helpful if willing to put in the time); unfortunately, each step describing the solution to your problem has a link to another knowledge base page that has a link to another page and so on... In my opinion, there is a massive gap of information in what UITS expects of it's users and what is actually implemented by them - especially in regards to computer security and database systems/management.""I work at the [IRD]. We constantly have issues with our computers and software. Our IT department does the best they can to help resolve the issues, but I feel the biggest problem is the wireless network. Also, computers that are hard wire sometimes will run slow or just freeze at terrible times. Another issue that I've personally witness is when my doctors and I out at Riley Hospital, their laptops don't always connect Axium, which contains important info and radiographs that they need access to, to be able to provide quality care to our patients.""I work for an IU function that is not on an IU campus and only has access to UITS services via phone or remote access. While we are required to use IU systems, the ability to access and utilize those systems is severely hampered by our location. Frequently, it is difficult to make the UITS responder understand our situation. While there have been efforts to improve this, we are still frequently hampered in our ability to function effectively.""I work in [IRD] at IUPUI. I am never sure when UITS needs to get involved when installing camera(s) and/or the best way to contact them. They tend to be an after-thought and either myself or the end-user has to scurry to find a way to reach out to them. We need to have direct access to someone at UITS to handle these types of ""data jack"" issues.""I would like to see a bit more clarity as new systems are introduced and old systems are phased out. For example, when I search for ""video conference"" in the KB, I do not see anything about Zoom on the first page. I think UITS could perhaps use more internal advertising to IU employees of different services along with their best practices and limitations.""I would like to see improved functionality for the Polycom system. Often the participants on the other end are blurry and there is a delay in sound. My office does several cross-campus polycom meetings every week, and our collaboration and communication are not at all on par as if we were in the same room. This is almost exclusively due to the quality of the polycom.""I would really like more of the trainings to be recorded and available for watch on my own time. I have looked for training on Excel and Outlook regularly, and I have not been able to watch recorded sessions once.""I would really like to have classes offered more frequently online regarding Microsoft Word, Excel.""Internet Explorer seems to shut down on me all the time. ""Some websites do not interface well with IE"" is what I have been told. I am unclear about whether or not I can download new browsers.""It would be extremely helpful to redesign the KFS portal. I don't like One.iu.edu overall, but the KFS app in particular is VERY inefficient. I'm speaking about the IU Enterprise Business Systems. Having to navigate through all the KFS options in a single list is a nightmare and it would be extremely helpful to be able to customize all the KFS options in a way similar to Onestart.iu.edu. We need the ability to view the options (and sub tasks) we need and hide the options (and subtasks) we don't. For example, ""budget"". Theoretically, we only use ""budget"" for several months a year, but we have to visually scroll through the list and see ""budget"" on a daily if not HOURLY basis. If we could hide the task until we need it, it would be wonderful! Not get rid of it, but have a hide and unhide option. From a finance person perspective, we pretty much despise the long list and sub tasks. We are in and out of so many of the tasks just to find the information we need for reporting etc., it really takes a lot of our time because we have to find the main task and then the sub task we need. It's difficult to quickly navigate because you have to keep going back to the main list!"It would be nice if Google would not go and come constantly and the internet sites failing all the time."It would be nice if the Symantec security software on the website specified it was also anti-virus. The description is not very clear that it is an anti-virus software and not just some other type of security software. ""Security"" can have multiple meanings. Also, it would be nice to have another ""bookmark"" app within One in which a person can save all of their bookmarks if they wish rather than saving them in the internet browser. Onestart had such an option and it was so handy to save important work related websites that I could access from anywhere in case I did not have my work laptop.""IU is a big organization and is hard to satisfy everyone needs, normally UITS responds very quickly to the clients."I've had excellent resolution of questions I've asked UITS about."I've only had positive interactions with the UITS staff. Services sometimes take multiple follow-ups for response. I really would like for the software developers of programs like KFS (or whatever it's called these days) & TEM to talk to the end users while the software is still in the development stage...so many things about these programs are NOT intuitive, making them more time-consuming than should be necessary. Also, it would be good for the developers to realize that most of the end users are not working in just that one program all day & switching mental gears can sometimes be difficult in a hurry. It would be GREAT if our various systems would communicate with each other.""I've taken one-on-one classes with UITS and they have always been very patient and helpful. It's easier to learn a new program for me when the class is ""hands on."""Just got back to the campus after a [IRD] year assignment with [IRD]. I was issued a new laptop and [IRD] was assigned to get my new computer up and running. He has been nothing but professional in his duties as he downloaded and upgraded the necessary software and doing various troubleshooting to make sure things were working like they should."Lynx is hard and confusing. difficult to make a simple call. Duo is cumbersome. Outlook crashes too much. I am hating VOIP phones....if your computer is down, there is no recourse in an emergency."My biggest concern right now is dead spots in your cell signal inside the buildings as well as the dead space and flakey Wi-Fi from weak signal areas or who knows what. "Please don't assume Wi-Fi is just students checking their Facebook messages, I need a solid and consistent connection so that I can be alerted to updates with my family (namely changes to our two worker household, or emergencies with our children in daycare).""Wi-Fi should be strong, stable and reliable first and foremost in even the most obscure areas of the buildings. Mobile should come at a close second.""My biggest concern with the UITS help line (317-274-help) is that I often encounter a staff member who is unable to answer a technical question or provides incorrect information. One example is when I called the help line last summer shortly after the university started issuing student ID numbers that started with the number ""2"" to ask for guidance on how to enter a series of ID numbers that start with both 0 and 2 into an Excel spreadsheet without losing the zeros. The staff member did not know that answer and didn't make any attempt to figure it out. I was very surprised by this, as I figured I was not the only person in the IU system who would run into trouble with spreadsheets and other documents that contain ID numbers once the new ID's that started with the number 2 were introduced. My coworker ended up finding the answer online. Another example is when I contacted UITS regarding an advisee who was newly admitted and was being blocked from creating a user account whenever he accessed the itaccounts web site. The staff member I talked to consulted with a supervisor and told me we had to speak with an admissions rep at IUB even though the student was admitted to IUPUI. I didn't think this was correct but followed the advice and confirmed that the information was incorrect. The staff member also told me that there was nothing UITS could do to fix the problem even though it was a technical issue. I ended up finding someone higher up the information technology food chain who was able to assist. My suggestion is to provide more training to front line staff and encourage them to try to troubleshoot or consult another staff member rather than simply saying there's nothing they can do to help.""My concern is the confusion relating to what UITS covers and what CNC is responsible for. I upgraded my teacher's station with hardware & software several months ago. The touch screen instructs you to call UITS for help, but when you call the telephone number listed on the screen, the responder sounds confused about whether the problem should be handled by UITS or CNC. ""When there is a problem, the average user does not know if it is a software or hardware problem, or user error. Avoid some of the confusion by listing both/all telephone numbers, and then give the user a choice based on the type of problem. For example; if it's software dial this number, or if it's hardware dial this number, or if it's after hours, dial this number.""My connection to UITS is minimal, but overall satisfactory. I do work with [IRD] and [IRD] and they are both always helpful. UITS did just loan projector bulbs from their inventory to Kelley School of Business which solved an urgent issue for us - greatly appreciated the support!""My experience with installation crews, managers and others has always been very good. My biggest frustration the past year has been with Outlook and all the issues that have probably been reported by hundreds others; but it still seems to disconnect after a time of inactivity and takes a minute to reconnect and upload any new emails and such. I'm also not a fan of DUO being applied to every CAS application as it does slow down your access to information (especially if you are already in a hurry). My only recommendation would be to find ways to maintain security without having so many logins and extra authentications.""My only concern are the updates that have been coming in the middle of the day around Noon. It is very difficult to stop doing work on emails, projects and tasks for a shut down in the middle of the work day, especially around lunch. I have come back to my desk to find my computer has completely rebooted and as a result have lost important emails or files."IU Secure is also very spotty and unreliable for a University of our size."My only thought and concern is that of a very frustrated end user. I work as an [IRD] employee in the department of [IRD]. I am physically located in an IUH facility and have had months of issues getting connectivity issues and the IUH IT and IU PEDS IT teams don't seem to work compatibly together. As an end user....I just want my stuff fixed and when it becomes a political mess amongst the IT departments, it just creates frustration and angst for the end user. I simply wanted to be able to access my server document without having to VPN and use a wireless connection in order to do my job effectively and efficiently. VPN and wireless is not reliable nor fast enough to do my job here....I may as well be working from home where I get better connectivity. While I do finally seem to have resolution.....it took approx. 2 months to get it resolved. Not acceptable""My professor was using Adobe Connect to record lectures in Fall 2016. It was not compatible with Macs. I emailed, and was basically told I was out of luck. No one offered other suggestions for me. ""I have an iupui.edu email. This caused problems with some of the IUware that I wanted to download. It would not accept that address. I had to email back and forth 3-4 times before someone told me I actually had an iu.edu address. The answers were short, short sentences. If the person had taken time to explain this the first time, it would have cut down on confusion and frustration. I still not get a satisfactory answer on how to log on using this other address. I was not at all happy with this lack of concern/explanation. My impression was the person answering did not care or was just lazy."NANo additional comments."Our department is in the middle of being absorbed by UITS and while I realize there are other factors in play the experience so far has not been positive. There have been very few decisions made as far as how the units will merge and what decisions have been made we have had no input on. Our department as it stands is very small and there is no reason that there can't be communication involving every employee instead of drastic decisions handed down that completely disrupt our work with no one held accountable or reachable. When these decisions are directly tied to technology services within the university it is especially disruptive to the customers we see daily and can't help. From what I've seen, person to person customer service is severely lacking, often to the point where I can't find someone able to help with an issue. I frequently have to provide customers with an email address to assist them, rather than actually being able to help with their problem, which is absurd.""Overall I am pleased with my interaction with UITS staff members and the services they provide. They have been responsive to the issues that I have had in the past and have been quick to resolve them. I would like to see an increase in the trainings (either in person or web-based) that are offered on the various software packages available to university faculty and staff. I am new to using EndNote and would be very interested in learning more about how to effectively and efficiently use it. I have spent a great deal of time fumbling through and trying to find relevant video tutorials on the EndNote site and other training sites. Another would be how OneNote can be used for organization of research and projects--two things that greatly overlap in my job. Or is there another software available to IU employees that is of better use for collaboration and organization of files? My job tasks/responsibilities involve projects that occur on a yearly basis as well as long-term and on-going research projects either on my own or in groups with colleagues both on-campus (IUPUI/IU system) and off-campus. Another would be how to better/more effectively use IU box or Google Drive or other cloud storage/collaboration software. Also, at my previous institution the Qualtric software was available to all employees, but to my understanding, this is only available to specific departments at IUPUI, is this true or a ""campus urban myth??"" On another note, THANK YOU for the switch over to the Zoom platform! This is a great improvement and has made collaborating with colleagues across campus (IUPUI/IU system) and off-campus much easier. I feel it is also important to note that I have only been employed by IU since [IRD] so all of my feedback is looking back to this date.""Overall, the UITS staff has been very helpful and attentive to resolving my issues.""Phones are horrid running on digital. I constantly have dropped calls, calls that ring 1 time and go straight to VM, and I'm sitting right next to my phone working. My boss thinks I'm never at my desk. "Many times it takes 30-60 seconds to get a ring tone to dial out or complete the call. Often I have trouble just making a call out.PLEASE get more consistent WIFI access throughout campus!! PLEASE! In particular in Walther Hall and surrounding areas."Positives are worked relatively quickly on getting me a new laptop and also allowed me to borrow a loaner so that I could continue my work. Negatives are that previously when I was acquiring a new printer it was an extremely long drawn out process. We ended up not even getting our printer until two months after it had been delivered to IUPUI. The only reason I knew it took that they had it that long was because I asked about the warranty. The other item that bothers me is that when I received my new laptop I received it with Office 2013 on it. However, any IT training is only available for 2016. When I received my new laptop in Fall of 2016 why did they not go ahead and load it with 2016? If you are no longer going to have training available for 2013 then you need to start upgrading computers to 2016."Ques 1 positive experiences: can't think of any (ever)"Ques 2 negative interaction: Communication is obtuse, esoteric and full of jargon - I can do the same to UITS in my field; also the ability to promulgate rules (seemingly) arbitrarily or without regard to impact on Customers operations is unhelpful.""Ques 3: improvements - give Customer some ability to address its own issues rather than completely dependent on UITS - UITS response times are slow, with little feedback and little positive resolution""Responses related to campus UITS was specific to IUPUI FIAD Tech Services that oversees FIAD departmental needs. Service is not timely and below par in regards to expertise and support provided. Their internal help desk system is not efficient, have had numerous tickets that take too long to be responded to and resolved. Webpage services are managed by having to request updates through this help desk system which is not timely or efficient.""The IT people are usually very helpful. I knew the Duo log on system was going to be implemented. However, I felt unprepared for the actual start up. I didn't feel I understood how to actually do the duo log on and that it wasn't very well explained. The email screenshots were hard to read. Just a couple of sentences to explain how to use Duo-log on would have been very helpful for me.""The IT people with whom I work most are [IRD] and [IRD]; who consistently go above and beyond, fixing anything we ask them to fix; helping with downloads, laptops, etc. They always come to us and complete work in such a timely manner that I feel like we are the only people in General Surgery with whom they work. But I know that is true for everyone. They are stellar!!!"The gentleman I worked with at the walk-in Help desk and those that I have spoken with on the phone have always been extremely helpful and courteous; as well as efficient and knowledgeable. Thank you all!"The Lync phone system is horrible. I often have to call vendors and they complain that I sound like I am in a tunnel. I've reported this to UITS but am told it's a common occurrence. I feel like most of my interactions with UITS are not resolved (by the person I am speaking to), leaving me feeling very frustrated."The Lync Skype telephone system needs to provide training for support staff because most don't know how to use the phone. They also are not able to transfer calls to voicemail which is very annoying when you have a meeting in your office and you have to let the phone ring so it can go to voicemail."The people I work with at UITS know how I feel about them and the services they provide. We've had many discussions. No need to recount everything here, especially when my comments are about to be posted on a public website."The person at the campus center was very helpful and patient explaining the DUO system."The School of Medicine has a LOT of issues with CIATS (which is now part of UITS). There is lack of transparency, lack of communication, lack of forethought- the entire experience is horrible and needs to be addressed."The transition from Travel@IU to the travel system within KFS has been very rough. There have been a lot of glitches along the way and a lot of delays."The UITS staff that perform the work within our building are always friendly, and efficient. I'm not sure if you have changed your process or not but I have noticed an improvement in communication when attempting to get work scheduled. This used to be a complaint of mine but it has improved greatly."There is limited use of UITS for the department in which I am employed. Our department has IT Specialist on staff.There should be a better way than using DUO for time cards."This past October, [IRD] was instrumental in resolve my issues with Qualtrics. He patiently worked with the vendor to fix the problem on their end. He made my work easier.""This year I communicated my needs for a UITS controlled computer classroom for special needs and those needs were met. I also had a help desk call concerning Canvas and those questions were answered as well. So, so far, everything has been good.""UITS has always been a great partner to Campus Facility Services. Those with whom I have worked directly are: [IRD] just to name a few. They are all helpful, informative, hard working and team players.""UITS is obviously understaffed. I do not blame the staff. But why are resources not being allocated to the very backbone of this university? We can appoint more Vice Chancellors but not allocate resources to support the functioning of basic services? Even requests for very small fixes that could save hours of human resource time each week are ignored. I don't really feel there is a UITS that offers service: Look at the list of tech requests, and how old are those requests?""The university is pouring money and resources through a black hole. I don't spend my time being creative. I spend my time, as do my staff, with dealing with silly/simple system errors that are repetitive. There is no leadership, no one at the helm to drive strategy for UITS initiatives.""UITS needs an internal service that helps UITS staff with security issues. UISO has been unresponsive and generally not helpful several times. Perhaps it isn't their job (to help with lay and complicated security/policy issues) which is fine, but where to go for advice? It would behoove UITS to offer a security consulting service related to advanced technical and policy security issues as well as professional staff to guide the implementation of security issues (especially those which do not yet have a clear policy)."UITS Staff are always timely in their responses and focused on finding solutions which is very much appreciated. I think the best area of opportunity is to make information easier to find regarding enterprise systems that may be beneficial for day-to-day department operations. There are so many systems available at IU it is difficult to find what systems are already here and difficult to figure out the capabilities of those systems that IU already has available.UITS staff are always very professional and approachable. I always appreciate the same day assistance with technology."Very responsive, positive experience, but I don't use UITS much. Don't care for Duo.""We deal mostly with CAITS, however UITS has been very responsive and positive to our needs. Especially when the tokens were introduced. It was very convenient to go to the campus center to have UITS's help. They set everything up for me, I appreciate it very much.""When contacting UITS, it's a 50-50 chance of assistance--sometimes helpful, sometimes not. It can take multiple days, if not weeks, to achieve resolution.""When I have a problem, the IT guys are always quick to respond.""Whenever I put in a work request, they always get back with me in a timely manner. The wireless internet service is a bit slow. I guess due to the construction, the service is either slow or not connecting at all.""While the knowledge base is a very helpful tool, it's written from a very 'techy' lens. Our office is constantly asked to help interpret what to do to fix things or to use products, etc. The help desk chat function is AWESOME. Would like to have many more online/recorded trainings offered so that they can be accessible at our convenience on topics like: SIS Basics, Admin Center (so that we can offer to a new staff member during their first week); IUIE trainings. Would like to have a way to sign up for 'alerts' when job aids are updated. (ittraining.iu.edu/sis in particular!)""While the UITS 4-HELP staff cannot always solve a problem or answer a question, they are highly trained, courteous and know to whom to transfer a high level issue they cannot solve. ""Since the mandate of using the UITS machine room, UITS needs to have test environments for classroom equipment and IUAnyware in both Indianapolis and Bloomington. I have run into firewall issues multiple times when getting software with licenses installed on classroom computers and IUAnyware. This delayed the implementation. Also, those responsible for classroom computers and for IUAnyware are very slow to respond and install software.""There are still areas where wireless service is spotty, mostly in older buildings around lab space."The question concerning how important are UITS systems and services is disingenuous given that that is the only way to get nearly all of the service UITS provides."While UITS is a fairly broad reaching, enterprise unit at IU, I have been able to interact with several different people advancing and supporting the work of those on campuses. I have been satisfied with the interactions and collaborations, and have increased the amount that I rely on UITS to assist me in my role at IU."Would like to see Fax service become HIPAA compliant."Would like to thank the staff, they were always pleasant each time no matter how long the lines were. Wish they would continue the gas cards etc., also the unlimited amounts. 75 isn't enough when you eat off your card & provide gas for household."

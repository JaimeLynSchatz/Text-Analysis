But something that might be helpful to future students is that you could teach them how to use the projectors, because I didn't have a clue how to use them when I got here.""I have only contacted IT for assistance once during my four years at IUPUC. The one time I contacted IT, they were friendly and helpful. As far as using the technology on campus, I am satisfied with computers systems and I really like Canvas, especially the mobile app. I have actually been able to complete assignments on the Canvas app. I also One.IU, but not as much as Onestart. On Onestart, I felt like everything was on one page, so I knew where to find what I needed, but with One.IU I have to find where everything is separately. One.IU is nice, because it has a mobile app and I have been able to register for classes right from the app. I just wish things were a little easier to find on One.IU.""I have only interacted with the UITS staff a few times, and I have found them to helpful and knowledgeable. They helped me with my computer's connectivity issues after upgrading my operating system. They also helped me get my email on my cell phone.""I think I have visited IT twice in my years at IUPUC. Both were positive experiences. They were so helpful- like happy-to-help; any one I spoke with: seemed quite knowledgeable, explained processes until I understood, seemed not at all rushed (I mean, plenty of time to help me), and made me feel comfortable to ask questions. (I had many.)"I have also emailed IT for help 1-3 times. I received prompt responses that were helpful. My latest question was answered thoroughly.I like the remote printing option."Love all the free classes, wish I would've taken note of them sooner.""So far, my experience with UITS services had been great.""The beginning of the current school year had multiple issues with the Wi-Fi, where connections would drop or students were unable to connect at all. This problem was fixed within a week, but it happens every year when the school year starts.""The mobile Canvas app does not work very well. I tried using it for a while, but it is very glitchy. I've noticed that it does not update grades and assignments as quickly as the website does, it may take up to two days before they are loaded onto the app. I've experienced problems with it only showing half of the assignments due at a time as well. It never seemed to work as well or have the full functionality of the website. Other than the problems with the app though, the technology and technology department at school have been extremely helpful."The printers work about 50% of the time. I sometimes suspect this is caused by the way in which you can't print a document until it's uploaded to a website. My question is: Why isn't there a chord connected to the printers so that documents could be printed directly from a personal laptop?All the UITS staff I have interacted with have been quite helpful with their solutions.Computers in LS building have been having issues with linking to the printers. Half of them work and half don't. It is very frustrating.I called for help and the way she had me print my notes cost me $4."Duo does nothing but make it more of a hassle to sign in to anything campus related, and I can't use it if I left my phone at home.""I cannot download Microsoft programs onto my iPad because IU Ware doesn't work well with Apple. Also, I hate the new printer program because I have to search for the printers a lot which makes me late to class. It shouldn't take me 20 minutes to print off a document. Not to mention, for me to use the ArcMap program for GIS, I have to walk to a computer lab not particularly close."I do not have anything to add. I believe that IUS has very good technology on campus."I don't know that I have ever worked with UITS staff. If IUWare is a service I like it, however, when it comes to web based services (MS Visio, specifically) I have trouble accessing them both on campus and at home. I had added it to class machines I use every other day for class and for whatever reason it is gone when I come back and hard to access. This could be a Citrix issue. In the Hillside labs having monitors below a sheet of glass is uncomfortable to type on and hard to read. Both of the classes I've taken in this room did not benefit from this set up and made following along harder than a traditional set up.""I feel like the IU Ware is complicated to access. The instructions are vague. In lieu of a download, I was instructed to login via an online access for which I had to create an account, username and password. The first dozen times it seemed very cumbersome. I would much rather have been offered a simple download. "The good news: When I called for assistance the staff was patient and stayed on the phone with me until the software was completely operational.I appreciate having the ability to use online tutoring via the writing center using a video cam.I have no issues!"I haven't used them personally, but my professors have needed them to come in and fix the computers in the classroom and they are wonderful. They have helped both times and taught us what to do if it happens again.""I remember a member of UITS staff getting my laptop synced with the lab printer. This person was very helpful in getting me set up quickly as I had a paper due the same day and the document was only on my laptop. I didn't have time to download to an online drive and access another computer. It was also a pretty funny encounter. I saw him sigh in relief and say, ""Thank God- it's not a Chromebook."""I think it would be great if there was a color scanner on the IU Southeast campus. As far as I know there are only black and white ones.I think they are doing great. I wish in Canvas you could change colors in the calendar part so I could tell the difference when I make an event.I wish that game systems were easier to set up in terms of online service."I've had good results with the people with UITS. I have run into problems that I couldn't fix since I am not a Geek. Whenever I have a problem, mostly with my laptop, they are very willing to help me. You have one very happy customer when things go well. And I'm still learning what else they can do."Less surveys please and more free paper and printing money."My main frustrations are the amount of time it takes to log into a computer on campus, and the NIGHTMARE of finding a computer that is actually able to print to a print station. Also, thanks to the printers on campus being routinely over-filled, we have all learned how to disassemble a printer to remove a paper jam--so thanks for the life skill?"My Wi-Fi doesn't work.N/AnonePlease be aware that the computers in [IRD] are often not working properly. And on several occasions we (several classmates and I) were not able to print to the printers in this area.Instructors are having issues logging into the system because of duo.Printers are often not connected to computers for student printing. Logging on to computers seems to only get longer. We have to enter half a dozen passwords to access anything through IU's portals. Problems with Canvas only continue to grow in number. The university accounts through google are horrendous. Administration has blocked all access to most of the useful add-ons.Printers are often not connected to the computers in the lodges."The duo sign in is, for lack of a better word, a pain. I don't always have my phone on me, and having to remember one more code as a student is more than likely not going to happen. I know that I am graduating, so I will not have to deal with it for much longer, but the duo sign in has made my last semester more stressful than it needed to be.""The IT support was able to aid me in figuring out a Canvas issue, and they almost always greet me when I enter the rooms where they are stationed.""The ongoing issue of printers disappearing from the computers in the computer labs causes quite a bit of frustration for myself and fellow students. Also, the lack of understanding that most professors have of how a computer works and how to link the devices has resulted in many times the IT people having to show up and fix it without explaining or teaching. Also, it is a known fact, and an overwhelmingly irritating one, that to log into any computer for the first time it takes anywhere from 5 minutes to 25 minutes, ranging to those that sometimes never log on that day. This delay is far more than we often have between classes, and it is extremely frustrating when we have to sit in front of a computer saying ""Preparing Windows..."" for 25 minutes, so much so that we are having to find ways to work around some of them and give up on others.""The printers disconnect from the computers provided by the university in the different lab locations on a regular basis. When they disconnect, they are often difficult to reconnect because of the enormous list of printers on the network. Therefore, if I am able to reconnect the printer it is after a long amount of time which is not always a luxury when trying to print off a paper quickly before class. Improving the network so that the computers and printers do not disconnect regularly would be advantageous in keeping the attitudes about the school positive."The printers in the life science building are infrequently connected to the computers."Also, it would be great if some formal training could be bestowed upon the staff that refills the printer trays, to simply throw the empty paper cases in the recycling bins instead of the trash cans (as I have witnessed countless times). As I can only imagine how many times this is replicated in a given day, this would greatly improve the recycling that is done on campus as I assume this is done on a rather large scale across campus. "Many Thanks!"The printers, at least in the biology building, have been really hit or miss. It's a pretty serious problem for a lot of us, who don't own printers."The staff is very helpful. It's mostly computer/printer errors that occur.The staff is very nice and helpful.The UITS staff helped me to set up an add block program to prevent unwanted adds from showing up on my laptop. The program has prevented adds from slowing my computer down. UITS also helped me to set up Canvas on my Android phone. I have no recommendations for now.The wireless network is ridiculously unreliable."They are always willing to answer general questions about IT when they are free, which is very enjoyable to have access to. Wish there was someone to speak to who was on campus more often, since IT at Bloomington does not necessarily have the ability to help with issues at Southeast."UITS has done a marvelous job. I love Canvas over Oncourse. Canvas is by far the best LMS that I have ever used. One.IU is very handy and Umail is very easy to use."Your system seems fine, but I don't have to actually use duo to log in, even though there was this push to get me to sign up for it. That seemed a bit weird.""I don't use the Wi-Fi network with my personal devices, because it's completely unsecured. The hardwired Ethernet network is fine though, haven't had any issues so far.""1. I seem to have printing issues often. It could just be me, but it's none-the-less annoying. ""2. IUSecure seems to randomly stop functioning at certain points. I never get disconnected, but the internet doesn't work.""Canvas seems to have a bug where it will not show the overall grade for a class, even though grades have been submitted."Wi-Fi connection is terrible no matter where I am on campus. It never stays connected."Even though the printers are downloaded on my computer, I have never been able to print from my personal laptop. It is just unneeded if it is not going to be used then if I cannot print."Getting issues is very time consuming and often takes several days. The IUK campus received new printers over the Winter Break and instead of installing them when no students were on campus IT decided to wait until the first week of classes to install the printers causing confusion and serious printing issues for students. "Several of the ""old style"" printer stations were still left around campus for about a month despite them not working at all and the Science building did not have student accessible printers for 3 weeks causing students to have to hike to the Library in order to print. Despite all of these issues several of the printers still have issues printing from student laptops as well despite IT being notified on multiple occasions. ""Then the IT department just hired a new Associate Director of IT who has no formal education in IT at all, he has an MBA now I am by no means a computer server expert but an MBA does not prepare someone to be a server admin."I am pleased with how UITS is currently. I have never had a bad experience with them and I greatly appreciate the service."I find that the staff on hand is helpful with upholding IT information and making sure that the campus is working, but they are incredibly slow at responding and the Wi-Fi still seems to work only 20% of the time without kicking off the students. It is very disappointing and frustrating as a paying student.""I have always had great experiences with UITS staff at IUK, especially the student assistants. I think that during the beginning of new semesters it would be nice if more than one person could be working the desk, as it always seems there is a long line up during the first few weeks."I have had pleasant experiences with the UTIS staff in fixing issues I have had with my computer or when my card wasn't working for printing.My biggest issues with IT is that printing is very difficult because not all printers work and sometimes the card readers don't work and it is confusing as to when you can and can not use your card for the printing. I hope they get the printing system fixed soon.I know the CAS.I think the services provided are beneficial and helpful for students that are not experts in technology. It would be better if the staff would take more time in explaining how to download the software when the student is a freshman for future reference. The Wi-Fi connection needs to be more reliable around campus. I always have difficulty connecting to Wi-Fi in Hunt Hall."I would like to see further Box integration with IU services, especially Canvas. Adding functionality for a Box file upload in assignments or direct import of files into Box accounts would help encourage the wider use of Box at IU."Make the Wi-Fi network strong enough to allow my computer to stay logged in without having to reconnect every 10 minutes.Positive experiences with staff and student workers.Only negative experiences with UITS has been with connectivity issues to the Wi-Fi network.The IU secure internet never works. The only way I can use internet on campus is to connect to some AT&T network.The new log in system I think is very unnecessary. I have been at this university for 4 years and have been simply fine with the log in system. But having to send a approval code to log in is just frustrating. Especially when it happened all randomly and not expected.The only complaint that I have is that many of the printers on campus have not been working properly.The staff was very helpful and I did not have to wait long to get the help I needed.There should be more than 1 window. I had to wait 20 minutes for a problem that took 5 minutes to fix."Typically, UITS staff are very prompt to respond to IT issues. There have been a couple of instances where they were needed immediately to assist in setting up a video conference before it started and they did not arrive prior to the meeting beginning. I'm sure they are busy all over campus, but it can be frustrating when the equipment does not work the way it is supposed to in the conference rooms.""UITS Staff are very polite, helpful, and prompt with services.""When I first came to IU Kokomo, I was nervous about getting a new computer, and learning how to use it. The guys in the IT, helped me. The helped me download things I needed, and helped me realize some things about my laptop. They made me less nervous about scoping out my laptop. I am very thankful for this service. I would like to learn more about the UITS services."

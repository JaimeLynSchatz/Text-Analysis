textAll my interactions and experiences were very good. Instant responses. Completely satisfied with the functioning of UITS."As a clinical research specialist working in the field, I needed tech setup (laptop, scanner, wireless hot-spot, etc.) upon my hire. As these things go, there were a few glitches in getting everything up and running. However, [IRD] (at the School of Nursing), was always quick to respond. He would come swiftly up to our office with a big smile, address any problems with ease, and has just been such a pleasure to work with. I often get frustrated with the things I don't have administrative privileges to set up on my computer (mapping to printers, installing needed software, etc.), but this frustration is lessened when I know there will be someone more than happy to come up and do this for me in a quick and courteous manner."Canvas messaging and discussions are very slow to update and are not as effective as other means of communication. We switched to text messaging for a group project to make sure everybody got the messages in our discussion without any time lag.Complete working hours on Saturday.Wi-Fi not accessible in every part of the lab.DUO is as annoying as it can get.DUO login is a waste of time for all the students."First of all, I am frustrated that certain labs are closed on weekends in Heron's main building. Secondly, I had an issue printing in one of Heron's labs (the large-scale printer produced an error message, didn't print my file, yet $20 was subtracted from my JagTag account). Most of the UITS employees could not help me and sent me from one to the next around campus. The level of experience and knowledge seems to range greatly in the UITS staff, and I have been frustrated several times. I have also sought out help and been met by closed doors when certain UITS offices were listed as ""Open."" On the whole, I have been very dissatisfied with the level of professionalism and availability exhibited on the IUPUI campus. I would not consider myself an expert regarding computers, but I am proficient, and at times, I felt I knew more than the UITS worker and had to help this person assist me with the computer."For the past three years I have had really great experiences with UITS. My Wi-Fi always works on my computer and my phone and I have heard of my classmates having issues but I have not had the same issues.I am happy with the services and the facilities offered at UITS. Please continue it all.I am very satisfied with the services and support offered by UITS. The staff were very helpful when I had technical difficulties accessing my google account which was required for my class discussion/Forum."I appreciate that UITS guides are online and available 24/7. However, the layout and accessibility of these is extremely convoluted and difficult to navigate. As well, though I have not had to in awhile, most direct interactions with UITS are not pleasant, as I feel talked down to."I don't have any comments at this time."I found Onestart and Oncourse very easy to navigate. I'm not too fond of one.iu.edu, particularly the more ""app"" or ""tiles"" style format, but I'm getting used to it. As of now, I have very little experience with Canvas, so I have no comment on whether it is better or worse.""I had 2 different problems, more on the technical side, and in both the cases, the person who helped me was quite friendly and the solution they provided worked.""I'd like to say, though, that documentation about double authentication on the UITS website doesn't cover all the user cases. For example, I had installed the app and registered for Duo last semester before it was compulsory, but later I deleted it. And when it got compulsory, even after installing the app I was not able to register for double authentication because it was sending the notification to the app that was uninstalled, and there was no way to change my preferences from app to call me. And I couldn't find any documentation to overcome the issue on official website."I had a great experience with UITS during orientation. They were helpful in getting my computer set up for an online program. The only thing I would recommend is more services for distance students or more advertising for distance services already available. When I have issues during the semester I don't really know how to get UITS help or even if it available from a distance."I had a very positive interaction with an IT person - I wish I could remember his name - maybe [IRD]? I am in the Exec Masters in Philanthropy program and all my classes are online. I had to engage with a listening thread and it wasn't loading. Of course I was exasperated and frustrated so I called the IT folks and miraculously he helped fix the issue. My browser, Chrome, was not allowing the thread to load so I had to switch to Mozilla.""I had trouble getting access to SPSS through IU Ware, but the IT tech helped me and he was very nice.""I hate Kaltura and Echo360. They are glitchy, sometimes quit, and have annoying interfaces."I find the discussion forum part of Canvas infuriating. It's an integral part of some of my classes and I don't think it's an effective mode of communication."I think the Wi-Fi is great, the software available is helpful, printing on campus is easy, Onestart gets the job done, and the tech chat is also good.""I have had generally positive experiences with UITS staff. I did have a negative experience where I was not able to upload a document for a class assignment, but the teacher later corrected this for me when I emailed her about the problem. I would appreciate it if general discussion boards in Canvas would initially include an option to upload materials, since the written posts for my assignments on the discussion boards in my classes are generally quite long.""I have had generally positive experiences with UITS. They respond quickly when I have had in-class issues, they have helped me when my account was compromised by a phishing email, they pick up the phone and are able to answer questions quickly and helpfully. I have also found the UITS folks to be really friendly. I have not ever had a negative experience with UITS."I have had positive experiences when I have called in for technology support and help."I have never had a chance to interact with any UITS staff but as far as I have heard they are very efficient. Apart from interaction, I have used different services provided by UITS."I have not had any issues with UITS."I have nothing but positive experiences with UITS. Every time I call or need a tech, someone responds appropriately and I receive the help I need. I would not wish to work with any other technology group on campus.""I haven't really had any interactions with the staff. If I had any complaints, I would say the computers take a long time to boot up. Also Canvas could be a little smoother to navigate.""I like everything of UITS except the job submission system. Karst/Bigred2/Mason have their own job submission requirements, which make things trickier."I love it when y'all do screen share and fix all my problems. Greatly appreciate it. Keep doing what you all are doing!"I love that I can ask almost any question and be directed to someone who can work with me on the issue until resolution. I also appreciate that UITS is always proactively forward-thinking and ensures that the IU community has access to the best products, especially through IU Anyware.""I recommend that UITS have a link put on Canvas. It was easy to find on the old Oncourse, but I fumbled around looking for help on Canvas.""I tried to solve this problem by phone, email submission, and finally in person. Being able to talk to a real person made all the difference and everything was all cleared in up minutes.""I wasn't able to find antivirus from IU ware. I do not like the fact that marks are posted on the very first page of canvas. In some courses like [IRD], one student has to sign in for the group assignment. This is done through Canvas. Once they sign in to Canvas, the other students in the group can see their marks for their last exam which to me is a violation of privacy. The marks should not be displayed on the homepage of Canvas."I will say when I started my online program I was worried about the technology end of it. Would I be able to understand and navigate the software? Would my IT problems be handled quickly since I wasn't on campus? How well would the systems work? Questions like that. Overall I'm extremely pleased with it. Everything was easy to understand and use and problems were fixed quickly. That's one thing I tell people who ask about my online program-The technology side of it was a breeze. IU and IUPUI know what they're doing when it comes to offering degree programs 100% online."I would like to be able to control canvas notifications by class. I'm an aide for a class, and don't need to have notifications for when assignments are turned in, but can't shut them off without shutting off all notifications. "Mobile.print.iu.edu has bugs that need worked out.I'm impressed that there is 24/7 service."I'm disappointed that there are too many multifaceted and complicated portals, sites, and apps with the conglomerate school: IU, IUPUI, IUSM, IUSB, IUSM-SB."Perhaps this could be simplified by being subdivisions under one umbrella?"As an [IRD], I have seen how Notre Dame uses the google interface with email. This can link communicate better with my macmail and gmail browsing in general than microsoft outlook. I prefer anything google.""It has worked well, but I often have trouble finding things I need to find on the website. It seems very convoluted and unnecessarily busy. I wish there was a way to only get what I need for MY campus, not all IU campuses."IU Box has some issues with updating other people's information. It is also a hassle to have to save and upload everything to put it into box. I do not like google docs but prefer this to box at this time for it is easier.I've had good experiences with UITS Staff. They are always helpful in helping me determine what my computer issues or software issues may be.Just not impressed that there's no way to control the 400 junk emails I get every day in my junk folder. It's only with my IU account. No one could help me."Last year, the law school printers offered a duplex printing option but that option has disappeared this year. For both environmental and simple space/quantity of pages concern, it would be helpful if this printing returned to the law school library. Also, the new OneIU page to access things such as OneStart, financial aid, etc. was confusing and felt like it was rolled out without notice or clear instructions on how to now access those services."lynda.com was really helpful."My biggest complaint is the Wi-Fi connection - it is often spotty and will disconnect my devices at random which leaves me in the dark on information I need, especially while I'm in class. This occurs with both the AT&T network and the IU Secure network (not sure if they use the same server/provider). I have never liked AT&T Internet as a non-business user and feel that students could get a much better ISP for the price we pay, especially since reliable, high-speed internet is a must on a college campus.""My one, and maybe only, complaint is regarding the Canvas system and some of its user interface scenarios."N/ANone"Now that I am familiar with it, I like Canvas. I appreciate that I can use it on my apple devices. My only suggestion would be to make wireless printing easier. At the law school, it is nearly impossible to get wireless printing to work."Please start working with Lynda again.Remove Duo Login from Canvas.Services are fine for my needs."So many ""systems"" and constant changing...Oncourse and Onestart and CAS and Canvas and another here and another there...this is ridiculous. Then your prof. asks you to use one he likes (TWEN)...c'mon man...so many different places and passwords and nonsense.""Sometimes it takes them a long time to respond to emails. Is UITS staff the same as SOShelp? If so, please respond to my requests sooner."The wireless reception is crappy sometimes too. Thanks for reminding me.The confusing part was when I kept receiving prompts to do the two-step login over and over again."The graduate students should have the allowance of printing 1,000 pages per semester. It is not fair to the respective schools (i.e. Liberal Arts) to have to pay for their graduate students to have such an allowance. This should be allowed by the university, just as it is allowed for the undergraduate students."The only comment I would make is to maintain the same kind of software in every computer. I have had the problem where I work in an adobe suit program in the 24 hour lab in the first floor or in the Graduate Lab in the fourth floor and when I bring that project to Marla or to 255 I cannot open it because the rooms have two different versions of the program."If every computer will have not only the same programs, but the same versions of them, it will be easier to work. ""Also please give immediate building access to students (especially graduate). This is my second semester here and I still don't have building access. I have requested it at least four times or more but I still have not gotten access. Sometimes I work until late and I'm forced to stay in the building because I cannot go out. Also if I want to come back on a late time to work at night I can't, and it is frustrating.""The services by far are good. UITS staff and services give the technical assistance as and when I have the need and have been a great help at peak times. I appreciate the effort. Continue the good work. The only concern is the computers take a lot of time to login. If anything can be done about it, it would be great."Thanks.The staff is patient and helpful and always solve my problems.The UITS staff was very helpful! Two gentlemen worked with me and they were very kind and did everything they could to solve my issue. It did take a little while for them to get back to me though."The UITS website is very informative and user friendly. I've used it several times to look up how to do something, like how to use IU Secure on my new phone. The IUWare website is also very user friendly. I also emailed UITS recently regarding a IUWare question and really appreciated the quick and thorough response.""This is a little thing, but I would like a way for our grades not to be shown on the dashboard of Canvas under ""Recent Feedback"" when we sign in. When I log in to Canvas during class, I intentionally scale down the size of my browser to hide my scores from people sitting behind me. It would be nice to have a setting I could change telling Canvas not to display ""Recent Feedback"" on the dashboard when I first log in.""UITS has been particularly important to me, an off-campus student. EVERY time I have called, the staff have been courteous, kind, and consistently helpful. They stayed with me until I understood and often walked me through the process for which I sought help. Because I have not been on campus more than a few times, UITS serves as an important representative of the IUPUI campus. UITS support has left me feeling welcome, included, and wanted as an IUPUI student. Thank you very much for such a positive experience!""UITS is nice. Once, I couldn't install Matlab student version, a staff at UITS helped my to work on it for 3 hours, by searching and checking every possibilities online. Though, the problem was not solved, I so appreciated his help."One suggestion. "Some computers could save my work for the whole semester after I logged out, but some will delete it immediately. I didn't know that and couldn't distinguish them."Could we put a clear reminder next to the computer?"Once I was working on a class project on one of our computers, and wanted to continue the next day. My works were all gone the next day, because I used a wrong computer.""UITS lab is a great place to work for me. The quiet zone is maintained quiet properly. However, the vending machine needs to be fixed as it doesn't read the jagtag. Also, the number of 2 screen workstations should be increased."UITS should be available all the time 24/7 for students to use and study.I use and like the collaboration rooms. It would be nice if the rooms had long white boards all over the wall."Being HCI students, we should get full access to AR/VR lab. All the latest technology devices like wearables and smart watches should be available for us to play with and test our designs. Usability test labs should be available with Eye tracking, audio/video recording etc. equipment.""Classrooms should be more of Auditorium form, present classrooms are inconvenient for us to interact with Professors, TA and watch Keynotes on the projector. They are not even feasible to interact with whole class."UITS staff attend to the students' need promptly. I believe they are doing good job.UITS was very helpful to me on a number of occasions.Very good IT service."When I had questions specific to IU School of Medicine technology, the UITS staff either were unable to answer or gave incorrect answers (specifically in regards to IU Notify and One.IU access - because Medical School starts a number of weeks before undergraduate but we have access at the same time so cannot complete some One.IU tasks in advance of our first Orientation day). Otherwise, the students have been helpful in answering questions about locating services online, different software suggestions, and privacy. I love the online web chat! It has been most helpful in answering questions quickly that are straightforward."Three of the librarians in Med Sci were unfamiliar with how the printers work and what paper goes in the printers. Librarians should be trained to use the UITS hardware to a reasonable degree."There are rooms in Med Sci and Emerson which do not support internet access (to Canvas and TopHat) when all 100+ medical students attempt to access internet at once. In particular, the Pathology Labs in Med Sci do not have any internet access very regularly. Some students have limited access and other students have none.""When I had trouble getting my DUO access to work, I received quick help all over chat which was very convenient. Typically though I can solve most of my problems with the resources IT provides on iupui websites (like setting up my email and changing important passwords and making my email work on mobile devices).""Whenever I have needed help with issues IT has been there, even on the weekend.""While I do think that UITS provides excellent products, there are definite areas for improvement. I would appreciate more integration of services into one.iu like accessing Canvas or e-mail services. It would be great if you could login just once and never have to input that again. I am very disappointed with DUO. It has definitely been a significant time drain."

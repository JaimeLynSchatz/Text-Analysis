To read in the entire directory simply put \"\\*\" (this time with the quotes) and this will read all files that end in .txt.

    "### Find Bigrams and Trigrams\n",
    "\n",
    "This code will most likely not need to be adjusted. It creates a model of bigrams and trigrams in your dataset that occur frequently and then connect them with an underscore so the Word2Vec algorithm will later consider them as one word. This is a good idea for items like 'new york' or 'new zealand' or 'Ho Chi Minh'. If we do not combine these frequently occuring phrases then 'new' and 'york' will be considered independently and give us less accurate results. \n",
    "\n",
    "Right now we have a min_count of 5 and a threshold of 100. The min_count is simply the minimum number of times the bigram or trigram needs to occur in order to be combined with an underscore. The threshold is a score that the bigram or trigram needs to exceed in order to be combined with an underscore. The threshold score is determined by using this formula: (bigram_count - min_count)\\*vocab_count/(wordA_count \\* wordB_count). So let's say we have the bigram good_lord and it appears 30 times in a text of 10,000 words where \"good\" appears 60 times total and \"lord\" appears 40. With our minimum count set to 5 we get the following: (30 - 5)\\*10000/(60 \\* 40) = 104.167 which means since our threshold is set to 100 \"good_lord\" will be combined with an underscore and made into a bigram. If the resulting score is above your threshold then the ngram is considered important enough to combine with an underscore and will be viewed as one word for the Word2Vec algorithm later. Therefore, if you increase the threshold, you will get fewer bigrams and trigrams. If our threshold was set to 110, then \"good\" and \"lord\" would not be combined into \"good_lord\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The Phraser function takes the model you built with the Phrases function and cuts down memory consumption of Phrases, by discarding model state not strictly needed for the bigram detection task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we take a look at the ngrams created from the first item in our dataset only, so the results are for only one chunk, not the whole dataset. We do this by counting the number of words that contain an underscore as this is used to connect the words in the ngram together. **NOTE:** The output is only to test if the ngrams work so you will probably see ngrams containing stopwords. We will create a few functions next and then apply them to remove stopwords, create bigrams, and lemmatize the chunk."

    "Below are functions we are creating that perform certain tasks. First we are creating a function to remove the stopwords that are in our stopword list we created previously. Then we create functions to apply our bigram and trigram code from above. Lastly we create a lemmatization function. What is lemmatization? Well, in our case we are using it to tag words as nouns, adjectives, verbs, or adverbs. A lemmatizer can also conjugate verbs and decline nouns into their root or infinitive/nominative form. This can be useful in topic modeling as the terms run, running, and ran will be changed to 'run' so you know if the idea of 'running' in general is a part of a topic. At the moment the lemmatizer is commented out. To use it remove the '#' from in front of all the bottom lines."

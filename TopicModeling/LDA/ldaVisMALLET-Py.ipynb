    "### Loading Packages\n",
    "As mentioned above, we will be using the gensim and pyldavis packages. In addition we will also be using a few other packages that help us do things like read through directories of files, make dataframes, or use natural language processing. Below is a list and a brief description of each:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **re:** Provides regular expression matching operations similar to those found in Perl.\n",
    "- **json:** Allows for handling of data in JSON format.\n",
    "- **sys:** Provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter. It is always available.\n",
    "- **os:** Provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality.\n",
    "- **string:** Contains a number of functions to process standard Python strings.\n",
    "- **csv:** Implements classes to read and write tabular data in CSV format.\n",
    "- **nltk:** A leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data.\n",
    "- **glob:** Finds all the pathnames matching a specified pattern according to the rules used by the Unix shell.\n",
    "- **numpy:** a general-purpose array-processing package designed to efficiently manipulate large multi-dimensional arrays of arbitrary records without sacrificing too much speed for small multi-dimensional arrays. \n",
    "- **pandas:** An open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.\n",
    "- **pprint:** Provides a capability to “pretty-print” arbitrary Python data structures in a form which can be used as input to the interpreter.\n",
    "- **gzip:** Provides a simple interface to compress and decompress files\n",
    "- **gensim:** Python library for topic modelling, document indexing and similarity retrieval with large corpora.\n",
    "- **spacy:** A library for advanced Natural Language Processing in Python and Cython.\n",
    "- **pyldavis:** Python library for interactive topic model visualization.\n",
    "- **matplotlib:**  Produces publication quality 2D graphics for interactive graphing, scientific publishing, user interface development and web application servers targeting multiple user interfaces and hardcopy output formats.\n",
    "- **logging:** Defines functions and classes which implement a flexible event logging system for applications and libraries.\n",
    "- **warnings:** Allows for the manipulation of warning messages in Python."

    "### Reading in .txt files\n",
    "The code below reads in text files. It can do this in two ways. We can read in an entire directory, or we can read in a single file. Remember, LDA generally works best on larger datasets, so if you are uisng a single file it should be a large file. In order to choose between an entire directory or a single file, look at the line of code that starts \"for path in glob.glob\" (minus the quotes). Towards the end of the line where there is something in quotes that ends in .txt is where you switch between the entire directory or a single file. To read in the entire directory simply put \"\\*.txt\" (this time with the quotes) and this will read all files that end in .txt. To read in a single file replace the \"\\*\" with the file name of the file you are interested in like \"myDataSet.txt\". \n",
    "\n",
    "The below code also lets you choose between reading your data in a file at a time or line by line. You can make this choice whether you are reading in an entire directory or a single file. However, your research and data will determine whether line by line or file by file is best. In order to choose which one you need the part of the code you need to change is where it says \"with open(textFilepath, \"r\") as f:\" (minus the quotes). The part following this is where the change is made. To read in the data by file in the folder make sure the lines that say \"for line in f:\" and then \"docs.append(f.readline())\" have a \"#\" in front of them as this comments them out and tells Python to ignore these lines. The line we want Python to read in order to read the data in by file is \"docs.append(f.read().splitlines())\" (again, minus the quotes). Now to read in the data a line at a time and group the data by line instead of by file simply remove the \"#\" from in front of the \"for line in f:\" and the \"docs.append(f.readline())\" and put a \"#\" in front of \"docs.append(f.read().splitlines())\". This will now consider each line, regardless of which file it came from, as it's own data element. "

    "### Find Bigrams and Trigrams\n",
    "\n",
    "This code will most likely not need to be adjusted. It simply looks for bigrams and trigrams in your dataset that occur frequently and then connect them with an underscore so the LDA algorithm will later consider them as one word. This is a good idea for items like 'new york' or 'new zealand' or 'Ho Chi Minh'. If we do not combine these frequently occuring phrases then 'new' and 'york' will be considered independently and give us less accurate results. \n",
    "\n",
    "Right now we have a min_count of 5 and a threshold of 100. The min_count is simply the minimum number of times the bigram or trigram needs to occur in order to be combined with an underscore. The threshold is a score that the bigram or trigram needs to exceed in order to be combined with an underscore. The score is determined by doing a count of wordA and a count of wordB then a count of the bigram of wordA_wordB and a count of the vocabulary of the entire dataset and then the min_count we set earlier. Then the min_count is subtracted from the bigram and that result is multiplied by the vocabulary count. This number is then divided by the product of the wordA and wordB counts. The formula looks like this: (bigram_count - min_count)\\*vocab_count/(wordA_count \\* wordB_count). If the resulting score is above your threshold then the ngram is considered important enough to combine with an underscore and will be viewed as one word for the LDA scoring later. Therefore, if you increase the threshold, you will get fewer bigrams and trigrams. For trigrams you simply divide by the product of all three words (wordA_count \\* wordB_count \\* wordC_count)."

    "Below are functions we are creating that perform certain tasks. First we are creating a function to remove the stopwords that are in our stopword list we created previously. Then we create functions to apply our bigram and trigram code from above. Lastly we create a lemmatization function. What is lemmatization? Well, in our case we are using it to tag words as nouns, adjectives, verbs, or adverbs. A lemmatizer can also conjugate verbs and decline nouns into their root or infinitive/nominative form. This can be useful in topic modeling as the terms run, running, and ran will be changed to 'run' so you know if the idea of 'running' in general is a part of a topic.  "

    "Choosing a ‘k’ (number of topics) that marks the end of a rapid growth of topic coherence usually offers meaningful and interpretable topics. Picking an even higher value can sometimes provide more granular sub-topics. If you see the same keywords being repeated in multiple topics, it’s probably a sign that the ‘k’ is too large. To choose the number of topics that might be best do not just use the highest coherence score. There are other factors that need to be considered. If the coherence score just seems to keep climbing higher and higher along with the number of topics, it might be best to find the number where it appears to stop and flatten out a bit before continuing to ascend. You do not want to run the risk of having too many or too few topics."

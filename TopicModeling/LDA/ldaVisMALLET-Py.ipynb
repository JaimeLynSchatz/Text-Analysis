In order to choose between an entire directory or a single file, look at the line of code that starts *paths =* (minus the quotes). Towards the end of the line where there is something in quotes directly preceding *+ fileType* is where you switch between the entire directory or a single file. To read in the entire directory simply put \"\\*\" (this time with the quotes) and this will read all files that end in .txt.

You can make this choice whether you are reading in an entire directory or a single file. However, your research and data will determine whether line by line or file by file is best.

    "### Find Bigrams and Trigrams\n",
    "\n",
    "This code will most likely not need to be adjusted. It creates a model bigrams and trigrams in your dataset that occur frequently and then connect them with an underscore so the LDA algorithm will later consider them as one word. This is a good idea for items like 'new york' or 'new zealand' or 'Ho Chi Minh'. If we do not combine these frequently occuring phrases then 'new' and 'york' will be considered independently and give us less accurate results. \n",
    "\n",
    "Right now we have a min_count of 5 and a threshold of 100. The min_count is simply the minimum number of times the bigram or trigram needs to occur in order to be combined with an underscore. The threshold is a score that the bigram or trigram needs to exceed in order to be combined with an underscore. The score is determined by using this formula: (bigram_count - min_count)\\*vocab_count/(wordA_count \\* wordB_count). So let's say we have the bigram good_lord and it appears 30 times in a text of 10,000 words where \"good\" appears 60 times total and \"lord\" appears 40. With our minimum count set to 5 we get the following: (30 - 5)\\*10000/(60 \\* 40) = 104.167 which means since our threshold is set to 100 \"good_lord\" will be combined with an underscore and made into a bigram. If the resulting score is above your threshold then the ngram is considered important enough to combine with an underscore and will be viewed as one word for the LDA scoring later. Therefore, if you increase the threshold, you will get fewer bigrams and trigrams. If our threshold was set to 110, then \"good\" and \"lord\" would not be combined into \"good_lord\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The Phraser function takes the model you built with the Phrases function and cuts down memory consumption of Phrases, by discarding model state not strictly needed for the bigram detection task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we take a look at the ngrams created from the first item in our dataset only, so the results are for only one chunk, not the whole dataset. We do this by counting the number of words that contain an underscore as this is used to connect the words in the ngram together. **NOTE:** The output is only to test if the ngrams work so you will probably see ngrams containing stopwords. We will create a few functions next and then apply them to remove stopwords, create bigrams, and lemmatize the chunk."

If we stem the word \"running\" most stemmers will convert it to \"runn\" only removing the \"ing\" and leaving the second \"n\". Stemming will also change \"police\" and \"policy\" both to \"polic\" and they will be considered the same word by the LDA script. The lemmatizer will leave both words as \"police\" and \"policy\".\n",

In the *sorted_df = doc_topics_df.sort_values(['topic_3','Filenames'], ascending = False)* you will need to change the 'topic_x' to match whatever topic you wish to have the table orderd by. This will allow you to see which documents in descending order have the highest percentage of your topic of interest. The syntax for the topic will always be 'topic_x' as it is going by the column name. If you want it ordered by file name then put 'Filenames' first. The primary order will be by which ever column header comes first, with the second column header being a secondary ordering option. This means if I order it by 'topic_5' first and then by 'Filnames' second, the data frame rows will be in descending order based on the numbers in the column labeled 'topic_5', but in any cases where the numbers in 'topic_5' are identical it will order those identical numbers by the corresponding contents of the 'Filenames' column.\n",
